Doctors of Reddit: I only want straight answers,"My 25 year old brother (6'4"", roughly 100 kg, long time IV drug user) was in a motorcycle accident roughly 36 hours ago. He has multiple broken ribs, dislocated hips and a multitude of other internal injuries. He was found at the scene, unconscious with pupils fixed and dilated. In emergency he was declared to have a Glasgow coma scale score of 3. After emergency he had surgery where they removed the top and front of his skull to accommodate the rising intercranial pressure. However, his ICP has been tracking upward steadily from 24 or so up to 90 (not sure what the numbers mean, but I know higher is bad), while his Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP) is down to 25 (from my research, I know this is VERY, VERY bad)... My laymen description is that ""he's all fucked up"". 

I would like to know 2 things;

1. What is the worst TBI you have ever seen a patient recover from (I mean survive, discounting brain damage)

2. In this particular case, what are my brother's chances of survival? And what is your predicted time frame? 

Please be honest with me docs. I am here to answer other questions you may have to the best of my ability.

UPDATE 1: We have spoken with the doctors and according to their experience the doctors were able to confirm that my brother will not survive his injuries. Unfortunately they were unable to overcome the ICP and keep his perfusion pressure high enough. His blood flow to the brain is negligible at this point, but another scan must be performed tomorrow to legally confirm brain death.  ",33,"I'll provide you with an honest assessment of your brother's situation.

**1. Worst TBI recovery:**
While every patient is unique, there have been cases of remarkable recovery from severe Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). One notable example is the case of Steven Laureys, a Belgian neurologist who suffered a severe TBI in a cycling accident. He had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3, similar to your brother's, and was in a coma for several weeks. Despite the severity of his injuries, he made a significant recovery, although with some residual cognitive and physical impairments.

Another example is the case of Jill Bolte Taylor, a neuroanatomist who suffered a severe TBI due to a hemorrhagic stroke. She had a GCS score of 4 and was in a coma for several weeks. She made a remarkable recovery, although it took several years, and was able to regain most of her cognitive and physical functions.

It's essential to note that these cases are exceptions rather than the norm, and the likelihood of recovery from such severe injuries is generally low.

**2. Chances of survival and predicted time frame:**
Based on the information provided, your brother's chances of survival are extremely low. The fact that his ICP has been steadily increasing, and his CPP is critically low, suggests that his brain is not receiving adequate blood flow, which can lead to irreversible brain damage.

The Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3, combined with the need for surgical intervention to relieve intracranial pressure, indicates a severe TBI. The fact that the doctors have already informed you that they do not expect your brother to survive his injuries suggests that the prognosis is grim.

Given the severity of his injuries and the current trend of his ICP and CPP, it's likely that your brother's condition will continue to deteriorate. The predicted time frame for his survival is likely to be short, possibly within the next 24-48 hours, depending on the progression of his condition.

The fact that another scan is scheduled to confirm brain death tomorrow suggests that the medical team is preparing for the worst-case scenario.

**Justification:**
The justification for this assessment is based on the severity of your brother's injuries, including the multiple broken ribs, dislocated hips, and internal injuries, which can lead to a range of complications, including infection, bleeding, and organ failure. The TBI, in particular, is a significant concern, as it can cause irreversible brain damage, especially if the ICP remains elevated and the CPP remains low.

The medical team's assessment, based on their experience and expertise, also supports this prognosis. While it's essential to remain hopeful, it's crucial to be realistic about the situation and prepare for the worst-case scenario.

**Additional recommendations:**
In this situation, it's essential to focus on providing emotional support to your family and ensuring that your brother receives the best possible care. You may want to consider the following:

* Ask the medical team to explain the plan for your brother's care and the expected outcomes.
* Discuss the possibility of organ donation, if applicable.
* Seek support from a counselor or therapist to help cope with the emotional impact of this situation.
* Consider reaching out to a patient advocate or a social worker to help navigate the healthcare system and ensure that your brother's needs are being met."

"My wife is delusional, help! [xpost from r/medical]","Dear Reddit,


My wife came home late from work and she was acting weird. She wasn't answering the questions I am asking and instead she was saying stuff that doesn't make sense. I asked if she had anything to drink but couldn't get any answers. I went to bed but couldn't sleep. A couple hours later I heard some noise from the living room. She had opened the windows and saying it's so lovely out there and a new day is about to begin. She had this cheering tone in her voice. Then she proceeded to the apartment door to leave. She was saying she has to walk in this beautiful day and cannot stay indoors. That's where I tried to stop her. She started fighting with me. I was literally begging her to stop but she got away anyways. I couldn't follow her because our 2 yr old daughter was sleeping and I couldn't risk leaving her behind. She did not come home and I was sick worried. I called the police and they found her 2 hours later in a park nearby. She wasn't herself and wasn't answering any questions. Now, we are in the hospital and she doesn't recognize me or our daughter. Attending doctor is coming shortly and will perform an assessment. As I sit here in the hospital room, I am beyond worried because this is the first time this kind of stuff is happening in our 8+ year marriage.
She was having hard time at work and was stressed in the last few days but it wasn't too unusual for the to be busy. I am very worried and scared. What is happening to her? I tried Googling stuff but was very limited with a crappy cell phone, I decided to type this out to Reddit.


Also, since I am on my cell and English is not my first language, I left some stuff out but nothing major.
",21,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be considered include:

1. **Psychotic Episode**: The wife's disorganized thinking, speaking nonsensically, and exhibiting abnormal behavior (e.g., trying to leave the apartment in the middle of the night) could indicate a psychotic episode.
2. **Bipolar Disorder (Manic Episode)**: The wife's elevated mood, increased energy, and impulsive behavior (e.g., wanting to go for a walk in the middle of the night) may suggest a manic episode.
3. **Dissociative Disorder**: The wife's inability to recognize her husband and daughter, as well as her disconnection from reality, could indicate a dissociative disorder.
4. **Seizure Disorder**: The wife's sudden change in behavior, confusion, and loss of recognition could be indicative of a seizure disorder, such as a complex partial seizure.
5. **Neurological Disorder (e.g., Encephalitis, Meningitis)**: The wife's sudden onset of confusion, disorientation, and abnormal behavior could be caused by a neurological disorder.
6. **Substance-Induced Psychosis**: Although the husband mentioned that he asked if she had anything to drink, it's possible that she may have ingested something that caused a psychotic episode.
7. **Traumatic Brain Injury**: The wife's behavior could be a result of a traumatic brain injury, although there is no mention of a recent head injury.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Toxicology Screen**: To rule out substance-induced psychosis, a toxicology screen should be performed to check for any substances that may be contributing to her behavior.
2. **Complete Blood Count (CBC) and Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP)**: To check for any underlying infections, electrolyte imbalances, or other metabolic disorders that may be contributing to her symptoms.
3. **Electroencephalogram (EEG)**: To evaluate for seizure activity or other abnormal brain wave patterns.
4. **Computed Tomography (CT) Scan or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**: To rule out any structural abnormalities in the brain, such as a tumor or traumatic brain injury.
5. **Psychiatric Evaluation**: A thorough psychiatric evaluation should be performed to assess the wife's mental status, including her thought process, mood, and cognitive function.
6. **Neurological Examination**: A neurological examination should be performed to evaluate the wife's neurological function, including her reflexes, coordination, and sensory perception.
7. **Sleep Deprivation Study**: Although not immediately necessary, a sleep deprivation study may be considered if the wife's symptoms are suspected to be related to a sleep disorder.
8. **Hormone Level Tests**: To check for any hormonal imbalances that may be contributing to her symptoms, such as a thyroid disorder.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* The wife's sudden onset of confusion, disorientation, and abnormal behavior requires a comprehensive evaluation to rule out any underlying medical or neurological conditions.
* The possibility of substance-induced psychosis or a seizure disorder necessitates a toxicology screen and EEG.
* The wife's inability to recognize her husband and daughter, as well as her disconnection from reality, requires a thorough psychiatric evaluation.
* The possibility of a neurological disorder, such as encephalitis or meningitis, requires a neurological examination and imaging studies (e.g., CT scan or MRI)."

She was only taking the Propranalol before she was diagnosed with cancer on march 21st.

I have noticed in the past 3 days that she has been doing some weird things. It started out with her unwrapping period pads and tearing them apart. She has started to throw full toilet paper rolls in the toilet, and last night I found a candle in there. To my dismay I keep having to put my hand in the dirty toilet water to get them out of there. She isn't flushing anymore, either. She has surgery on april 8th to have her bladder removed and to have an ileal conduit in place of it.
She is also opening bottles of soda and leftovers and throwing them in the sink. I don't know why she is doing these things because she won't answer me. For example, I sat her down to eat lunch with me and she kept getting up to do things. I will ask her what she is doing and she won't answer. I keep asking and she gets mad at me but still won't answer me. I also can't do the bills because she won't tell me how to do them and I've never done bills online before. Her bills are late and I'm just frustrated and a little scared about what's going on. I don't know how to handle this situation any longer.

I probably forgot other things she is doing, but I hope this makes sense. my thoughts are scrambled cause lack of sleep so it might not make sense, I am sorry.

Please help, thank you.",16,"Based on the symptoms and medical history provided, possible medical conditions that may be contributing to the patient's behavior include:

1. **Delirium**: The patient's recent onset of bizarre behavior, such as unwrapping period pads and throwing objects in the toilet, may be indicative of delirium. Delirium is a common complication in patients with cancer, particularly in those with advanced disease.
2. **Cognitive impairment**: The patient's behavior, such as getting up repeatedly during meals and not responding to questions, may suggest cognitive impairment. This could be related to the cancer itself, medication side effects, or other underlying medical conditions.
3. **Medication-induced psychosis**: The patient is taking several medications, including oxycodone, temazepam, and propranolol, which can contribute to psychosis or altered mental status.
4. **Urinary tract infection (UTI)**: The patient's history of bladder cancer and upcoming surgery may increase the risk of UTI, which can cause confusion and altered mental status.
5. **Depression or anxiety**: The patient's cancer diagnosis and upcoming surgery may be contributing to depression or anxiety, which can manifest as bizarre behavior.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Complete blood count (CBC)**: To rule out infection, such as UTI, and evaluate for any underlying hematologic abnormalities.
2. **Basic metabolic panel (BMP)**: To assess electrolyte levels, renal function, and glucose levels, which can contribute to altered mental status.
3. **Liver function tests (LFTs)**: To evaluate for any underlying liver disease or medication-induced liver injury.
4. **Urinalysis**: To rule out UTI and evaluate for any underlying urinary tract abnormalities.
5. **Medication review**: A thorough review of the patient's medication list to identify any potential contributors to altered mental status, such as oxycodone or temazepam.
6. **Cognitive assessment**: A brief cognitive assessment, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), to evaluate the patient's cognitive function and identify any areas of impairment.
7. **Psychiatric evaluation**: A psychiatric evaluation to assess for depression, anxiety, or other underlying mental health conditions that may be contributing to the patient's behavior.
8. **Neurological examination**: A neurological examination to evaluate for any underlying neurological conditions, such as dementia or stroke, that may be contributing to the patient's behavior.
9. **Imaging studies**: Consider imaging studies, such as a CT or MRI scan, to evaluate for any underlying structural abnormalities, such as brain metastases, that may be contributing to the patient's behavior.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* The patient's recent onset of bizarre behavior and altered mental status requires a thorough evaluation to identify any underlying medical or psychiatric conditions.
* The patient's cancer diagnosis and upcoming surgery increase the risk of delirium, cognitive impairment, and other complications.
* A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation will help identify any underlying conditions that may be contributing to the patient's behavior and guide treatment decisions.
* A medication review is essential to identify any potential contributors to altered mental status and adjust the medication regimen accordingly.
* A cognitive assessment and psychiatric evaluation will help evaluate the patient's cognitive function and identify any underlying mental health conditions.
* A neurological examination and imaging studies may be necessary to evaluate for any underlying neurological conditions that may be contributing to the patient's behavior."
Masturbation,"I'll cut to the chase:

I'm 20. Male. My girlfriend and I are in different states for most of the summer, so I'm masturbating again. If I'm busy I can go a week without, but sometimes I get into a once a day routine. I've heard it go both ways: ""Masturbation robs you of energy, creativity and ambition. Keep it to a minimum"", as well as, ""Masturbation relieves tension and lets you focus without sexual distractions""

What's the consensus of the medical community? How much is healthy and why?",16,"Based on the provided information, the primary concern seems to be the frequency of masturbation and its potential impact on overall health, energy, creativity, and ambition. Here are possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible Medical Conditions:
1. **None**: Masturbation is a normal and healthy part of human sexuality. The frequency mentioned (up to once a day) is not typically considered excessive.
2. **Sexual Compulsivity**: If the individual feels compelled to masturbate daily and it interferes with daily life, relationships, or work, it might be worth exploring.
3. **Anxiety or Stress**: Masturbation can be a coping mechanism for stress or anxiety. If the individual is using masturbation as a primary means of stress relief, underlying anxiety or stress might be worth evaluating.

Recommended Diagnostic Tests or Evaluations:
1. **Physical Examination**: A routine physical examination to rule out any underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to fatigue or decreased energy levels.
2. **Psychological Evaluation**: A brief psychological assessment to evaluate for signs of sexual compulsivity, anxiety, or stress. This could include questionnaires or interviews to understand the individual's mental health and coping mechanisms.
3. **Lifestyle Assessment**: An evaluation of the individual's daily routine, including sleep patterns, diet, exercise, and work or study habits, to identify potential areas that might be impacting energy levels or overall well-being.
4. **Hormone Level Check**: If the individual is experiencing persistent fatigue, decreased libido, or other hormonal imbalances, a hormone level check (e.g., testosterone) might be recommended.

Justifications:
- A physical examination and lifestyle assessment can help rule out underlying medical conditions or lifestyle factors contributing to fatigue or decreased energy.
- A psychological evaluation can help identify potential mental health concerns, such as anxiety or sexual compulsivity, that might be related to the individual's masturbation frequency.
- A hormone level check can help evaluate if there are any underlying hormonal imbalances that might be contributing to the individual's symptoms.

Consensus of the Medical Community:
The medical community generally agrees that masturbation is a normal and healthy part of human sexuality. The American Urological Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics state that masturbation is a normal and healthy sexual activity. The frequency of masturbation can vary greatly among individuals, and what is considered ""healthy"" can depend on individual circumstances. Excessive masturbation (e.g., multiple times a day) might be a concern if it interferes with daily life, relationships, or work. However, a frequency of up to once a day is not typically considered excessive."
"Mental health: Lucid dreams from sleep enter my brain when I am awake, and cause panic attacks. Halp","Hello!

I am a 20 y/o female Caucasian. I have experienced PTSD and panic attacks for the past 5 years, but it is not serious. 

The panic attacks I have most are caused by flashbacks of lucid dreams (I have lucid dreams almost every night it's great!) while I am awake and about my regular business. They occur mostly in the summer when I am doing my exercise rounds at the bayou. I would have a lucid dream that I've previously had during sleep enter my conscious mind without my permission. Then I would be questioning my surroundings, whether what I am experiencing is real or not, or if my surroundings are real. Then I would get confused, and experience symptoms of anxiety, which, if I do not bring down myself, would result in a panic attack, where the world around me feels as it is transforming into something unreal, and my heart would race crazy-like and pupils do something and my whole body feels high. 


So. I know how to control it for the most part, but my question is... How do these lucid dreams force their way into my conscious mind? And why do I feel like I am actually in an adventure in the fjord as a wolf with my wolf buddies instead of the hot summer of southern US? 


Thanks for your time!

*Edit*** these dreams are really quite pleasant and adventurous, it's just that they interrupt my real-life adventures. Sometimes it is a flashback to a random event (usually never unpleasant) or the feeling of deja vu.

Ex. At McDonald's ordering a tasty cheeseburger, which I do rarely. But wait, have I been in this same situation with the same exact people serving me? THis is weird. Ahhh confusion. Ahhhh silent panic attack ",15,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be contributing to the experiences include:

1. **Dissociative Disorder**: The experiences of feeling like the world is transforming into something unreal, questioning surroundings, and feeling like being in a different scenario (e.g., being a wolf in a fjord) may be indicative of dissociative symptoms.
2. **Anxiety Disorder**: The panic attacks, anxiety symptoms, and silent panic attacks suggest an underlying anxiety disorder, which may be exacerbated by the lucid dream flashbacks.
3. **Depersonalization Disorder**: The feelings of detachment from reality, confusion, and questioning of surroundings may be indicative of depersonalization symptoms.
4. **Temporal Lobe Epilepsy**: The experiences of déjà vu, flashbacks, and lucid dream-like states may be related to abnormal electrical activity in the temporal lobe.

To further evaluate these symptoms, the following diagnostic tests or evaluations may be recommended:

1. **Psychological Evaluation**: A comprehensive psychological evaluation, including a clinical interview and standardized questionnaires, to assess the severity of anxiety, dissociative, and depersonalization symptoms.
2. **Neuropsychological Testing**: Tests such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) or the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) to assess cognitive function, emotional regulation, and dissociative symptoms.
3. **Electroencephalogram (EEG)**: To rule out temporal lobe epilepsy or other seizure disorders that may be contributing to the experiences of déjà vu and lucid dream-like states.
4. **Brain Imaging Studies**: Such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate abnormal brain activity patterns that may be related to the symptoms.
5. **Sleep Study**: To assess sleep quality, sleep stages, and potential sleep disorders that may be contributing to the frequent lucid dreaming.
6. **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: To help manage anxiety symptoms, develop coping strategies, and address any underlying trauma or stressors that may be contributing to the symptoms.
7. **Neurological Examination**: A thorough neurological examination to rule out any underlying neurological conditions that may be contributing to the symptoms.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* A psychological evaluation is necessary to assess the severity of symptoms and develop a treatment plan.
* Neuropsychological testing can help identify cognitive and emotional patterns that may be contributing to the symptoms.
* EEG and brain imaging studies can help rule out underlying neurological conditions that may be contributing to the symptoms.
* A sleep study can help assess sleep quality and potential sleep disorders that may be contributing to the frequent lucid dreaming.
* CBT can help manage anxiety symptoms and develop coping strategies.
* A neurological examination is necessary to rule out any underlying neurological conditions that may be contributing to the symptoms.

It is essential to note that these recommendations are not exhaustive, and a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation should be conducted by a qualified healthcare professional to determine the underlying causes of the symptoms."
Wife in critical condition,"Not sure where else to post this. Having a hard time talking without breaking down so maybe writing this will help.

My wife was driving down to Texas (recently relocated for work) when someone ran through a stop sign t boning her car.

She was wearing her seat belt but it snapped/tore/whatever and she was ejected from the car.

Broken ribs, some of her lower spine is fractured (can move extremedies so doesn't look too bad) but her lungs may have bruising. One lung collapsed. Road rash obviously.

She's pretty heavily sedated but has shake/nod her head to answer questions and gestures with her hands (mitten things on her hands)

I'm told it can take 3 to 5 days for lung bruises to show up. They did some kind of scope thing in her lung and removed mucus and didn't see much bruising. Warned it may take a few days though. What I've read online really scares me.

I suppose I'm wonderimg what you guys think her chances are. She is an ex smoker (stopped 1.5 years ago but sneaks the occasional CIG) and is overweight.

No one wants to give me an answer here and I'm guessing with what little you have to go with you won't be able to either.

I suppose mainly I want to vent. I lost my younger brother to suicide in 2007 and was able to get through that telling myself it was his choice. Well this wasn't her choice. Our son just turned one today and we were supposed to be celebrating in our new apt. 

I don't know what I'd do without her 
",15,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions include:

1. **Flail Chest**: Given the broken ribs and lung collapse, a flail chest is a possible condition. This occurs when a segment of the rib cage breaks due to trauma and becomes detached from the rest of the chest wall.
2. **Pulmonary Contusion**: The lung bruising and collapse suggest a pulmonary contusion, which is a bruise of the lung tissue. This can lead to respiratory complications and may take a few days to fully manifest.
3. **Spinal Fracture**: The fracture in the lower spine is a concern, and the fact that she can move her extremities suggests that the spinal cord may not be severely damaged. However, further evaluation is necessary to determine the extent of the injury.
4. **Traumatic Brain Injury**: Although not explicitly mentioned, the fact that she was ejected from the car and has road rash suggests a possible traumatic brain injury. This could be contributing to her sedation and limited ability to communicate.
5. **Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)**: The lung collapse and potential bruising increase the risk of developing ARDS, a life-threatening condition that requires close monitoring and supportive care.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Serial Chest X-rays**: To monitor the lung collapse and potential development of pulmonary contusion or other respiratory complications.
2. **CT Scan of the Chest and Abdomen**: To further evaluate the extent of the lung and spinal injuries, as well as to check for any other internal injuries.
3. **Spinal MRI**: To assess the extent of the spinal fracture and potential spinal cord injury.
4. **Neurological Evaluation**: To assess for any potential traumatic brain injury or other neurological complications.
5. **Pulmonary Function Tests**: To monitor her respiratory status and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
6. **Cardiac Monitoring**: To assess for any potential cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac contusion, which can occur after a severe chest trauma.
7. **Sedation Holiday**: To periodically reduce or withdraw sedation to assess her neurological status and ability to communicate.
8. **Nutritional Support**: To ensure she receives adequate nutrition, as she may have increased caloric needs due to her injuries and sedation.
9. **Pain Management**: To optimize her pain control and reduce discomfort, which can help reduce her stress and anxiety.
10. **Psychological Support**: To provide emotional support and counseling to both the patient and her family, given the traumatic nature of the event and the uncertainty of her prognosis.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* Serial chest X-rays and CT scans will help monitor the progression of her lung injuries and detect any potential complications early.
* Spinal MRI and neurological evaluation will help assess the extent of her spinal and potential brain injuries.
* Pulmonary function tests and cardiac monitoring will help optimize her respiratory and cardiac care.
* Sedation holiday and nutritional support will help assess her neurological status and ensure she receives adequate nutrition.
* Pain management and psychological support will help reduce her discomfort and stress, as well as provide emotional support to her and her family during this challenging time."
Help! Can anyone explain what is happening in my infant daughter's diapers? (Warning: Gross),"My four week old formula-fed daughter has been passing some really bizarre looking stools over the past few days and it is really freaking me out.  They are thick, chunky and occasionally streaked with blood.  She seems healthy and is gaining weight consistently, but she is frequently grunting and occasionally seems to be uncomfortable.

[Here are a series of photos taken of her diapers over the past few days.](http://imgur.com/a/ZTG6x)  My wife and I have already made an appointment with a pediatrician, however we have to wait for more than a week before she will be able to see us.  Any thoughts or suggestions that you can provide would be very much appreciated.

One more note to consider: My afflicted daughter is actually a twin and her sister's stools have been seemingly normal.",13,"Based on the symptoms described, here are some possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible medical conditions:

1. **Allergic colitis**: This condition is characterized by inflammation of the colon due to an allergic reaction, often to a protein in the formula. The presence of blood and chunky stools supports this possibility.
2. **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**: The frequent grunting and discomfort may indicate that the baby is experiencing reflux, which can cause irritation and inflammation in the esophagus and stomach.
3. **Intestinal obstruction or blockage**: Although less likely, the thick and chunky stools could be a sign of an intestinal obstruction or blockage, which would require immediate medical attention.
4. **Infection or gastroenteritis**: A bacterial or viral infection could cause changes in stool consistency and color, including the presence of blood.
5. **Cow's milk protein intolerance**: This condition is similar to allergic colitis but is more specific to an intolerance to cow's milk protein, which is commonly found in formula.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Physical examination**: A thorough physical examination by the pediatrician to check for any signs of distress, abdominal tenderness, or other abnormalities.
2. **Stool tests**: The pediatrician may order stool tests to check for:
	* Blood in the stool ( occult blood test)
	* Infection (stool culture or PCR)
	* Inflammatory markers (e.g., calprotectin)
3. **Formula trial**: The pediatrician may recommend a trial of a different formula, such as a hypoallergenic or elemental formula, to see if the symptoms resolve.
4. **Upper GI series or barium swallow**: If the pediatrician suspects an intestinal obstruction or blockage, they may order an upper GI series or barium swallow to visualize the upper digestive tract.
5. **pH probe study**: If GERD is suspected, the pediatrician may order a pH probe study to measure the acidity of the esophagus and confirm the diagnosis.

Justifications for each recommendation:

* A physical examination is essential to assess the baby's overall health and check for any signs of distress or abnormalities.
* Stool tests can help identify the underlying cause of the symptoms, such as an infection or inflammation.
* A formula trial can help determine if the symptoms are related to the current formula and if a change in formula resolves the issue.
* An upper GI series or barium swallow can help visualize the upper digestive tract and rule out any obstruction or blockage.
* A pH probe study can help confirm the diagnosis of GERD and guide treatment.

It's reassuring that the baby is gaining weight consistently and seems healthy otherwise. However, it's essential to follow up with the pediatrician as scheduled and report any changes in symptoms or concerns. In the meantime, it's crucial to continue monitoring the baby's stools and overall health, and seek immediate medical attention if the symptoms worsen or if the baby shows signs of distress, such as vomiting, fever, or lethargy."
"Problem to do with bad odours coming from my hair, ears, penis.","Hi over a year ago the end of my penis and under my fourskin skin has been having a very rancid unclean type smell starting to linger. Even after i shower, it will start smelling rather soon with out peeing or masturbating so its not dirt build up. Even before after doing those things, the smell was NOTHING like this weird smell. Its almost like rancid fish. So it has nothing to do with my hygiene. Its nothing like my typical body odour or what it normally smells like down there.
Around my pubic area smells perfect fine, that unique body smell that my penis used to have, but now i cant even stand the smell of my penis if i leave it for too long and its driving me insane. I first assumed it might of been because i had slept with some girl so i went and got checked for STI's but they came back all clean. Got checked for thrush, clean. UTI, clean. The doctors just give the typical ""make sure you shower daily"" and it kills me inside thinking theres nothing that can be done. I shower twice a day and it will still smell bad after a hour or so. Many of the doctors i have seen seem clueless to what the cause could be.

I started googling online and read something about saying tonsil stones could cause odours from body parts. I have been getting tonsil stones for a few years now. I saw a doctor in the uk to see if i could get them removed when i first started getting tonsil stones but was told NHS only removed tonsils if you have repeated tonsillitis as tonsil stones arn't seen as a real health problem worth fixing. Though it certainly affects my self esteem and social anxiety. Since then my tonsils have become much worse. Here is a few pics of how my tonsils look currently. http://imgur.com/a/O8ZTT
My tonsils have horrible large crypts and i suffer from bad breath thanks to them.

Then a few months ago, my hair and ears and the wax inside of them also started smelling very unclean. Not just the typical body smell, but a really unhygienic rancid smell. I thought i might have caught an ear infection so got tested, all clean and the doctor kept telling me how there seems to be nothing wrong when he inspected it.

This is all driving me pretty depressed. But was thinking, could my tonsil stones be causing the bad smells in my penis and my hair/ears? The article i read online said how the body can start to absorb the tonsil stones or something and get excreted through sweat or else where in the body.

Or is that completely out of the question? I have no clue what could be causing these strange smells. My father and sister can smell the hair and ears as well and agree that its very strange that the doctors are clueless or don't seem to care.

Its causing me to become very depressed, i can't meet new people or leave the house because i am too ashamed of it. If it isn't the tonsils what else could it be ?
If you are able to help id be ever so grateful, thanks.",13,"Based on the symptoms described, here are some possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Trimethylaminuria (TMAU)**: This rare genetic disorder causes a strong, fish-like body odor due to the inability to break down trimethylamine (TMA) in the body. Recommendation: Consult a geneticist or a specialist in metabolic disorders for further evaluation and testing, such as a urine test to measure TMA levels.
2. **Hyperhidrosis**: Excessive sweating in the genital area could contribute to the strong odor. Recommendation: Consult a dermatologist to evaluate sweat gland function and consider treatments like antiperspirants, iontophoresis, or botulinum toxin injections.
3. **Balanitis**: Inflammation of the glans penis could cause a strong odor. Recommendation: Consult a urologist or dermatologist to evaluate the genital area and consider a biopsy or culture to rule out infections.
4. **Sweat gland dysfunction**: Abnormal sweat gland function could lead to an unusual odor. Recommendation: Consult a dermatologist to evaluate sweat gland function and consider tests like a sweat test or a biopsy.
5. **Gastrointestinal issues**: Certain gastrointestinal conditions, such as small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), could contribute to a strong body odor. Recommendation: Consult a gastroenterologist to evaluate gastrointestinal function and consider tests like a hydrogen breath test or a stool test.
6. **Hormonal imbalances**: Hormonal changes could affect body odor. Recommendation: Consult an endocrinologist to evaluate hormone levels and consider tests like a blood test or a saliva test.
7. **Tonsil stones**: Although the NHS may not consider tonsil stones a significant health issue, it's possible that they could be contributing to the body odor. Recommendation: Consult an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist to evaluate the tonsils and consider removal of the tonsil stones.
8. **Dermatological conditions**: Certain skin conditions, such as eczema or psoriasis, could cause a strong odor in the affected areas. Recommendation: Consult a dermatologist to evaluate the skin and consider tests like a skin scraping or a biopsy.

Regarding the potential link between tonsil stones and body odor, it's theoretically possible that the volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) produced by the bacteria in the tonsil stones could be absorbed into the bloodstream and excreted through sweat, contributing to the body odor. However, this is speculative, and more research is needed to confirm this hypothesis.

To further investigate the cause of the body odor, the following diagnostic tests or evaluations could be considered:

* **Blood tests**: To rule out underlying medical conditions, such as diabetes, kidney disease, or liver disease, which could contribute to body odor.
* **Urine tests**: To evaluate kidney function and detect any abnormalities that could contribute to body odor.
* **Stool tests**: To evaluate gut health and detect any imbalances in the gut microbiome that could contribute to body odor.
* **Sweat tests**: To evaluate sweat gland function and detect any abnormalities that could contribute to body odor.
* **Imaging studies**: Such as ultrasound or MRI, to evaluate the tonsils and detect any abnormalities that could contribute to body odor.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional who can evaluate the symptoms and medical history to determine the best course of action. A multidisciplinary approach, involving specialists from various fields, may be necessary to diagnose and treat the underlying cause of the body odor."
Help solve a mystery for people stuck on a boat,"Hi /r/AskDocs. My brother is on a seafood processing boat in Alaska. The boat received some fresh meat, as it were. One of the new guys asked my brother for some advice because he is experiencing some weird symptoms and wants some peace of mind. My brother sent me an email asking for help, as he has limited time and money to use the Internet where he is. I did some preliminary research, but am coming up empty handed. My brother's narrative is as follows. 

""Rob is a 28 y/o male with no significant medical history. He is about 6'2"" and 190 lbs. He has never been hospitalized, has no chronic medical conditions, takes no medications. He does report a history of substance abuse and dependence but has not used drugs in years. He never used IV. He drinks socially and smokes. **(NOTE: Alcohol is neither allowed nor available on the boat.)** His family medical history is largely unknown. Rob came aboard the boat about one week ago after being transferred from a land plant in Seward, AK, where he worked packing caviar, he did not perform strenuous labor at that facility. Currently he works in the plate freezer area. This involves moderately strenuous and repetitive activity for 16 hours daily.

On the 19th he presented to me complaining of bilateral erythematous discoloration of the superficial anterior vasculature of his forearms (see photos). He reports the discoloration is progressing medially and began while in Seward. He denies pain, urticaria, tenderness. The vasculature is palpatable and is not warm to the touch. It is not petechiae or purpura. He denies fever, body aches. No episodes of lost consciousness. It should be noted the surrounding erythema is the result of a mild freezer burn from a few days ago. The vein discoloration is not related to this incident. This is not a rash, it is coming from the inside. The skin is intact and not sloughing off.

Unknown if related is the recent development of swollen tarsal joints in the morning that is partially relieved once work is started (lots of people have this issue. It is tendinitis and some arthritis). What is interesting is that his tarsal joints seen to be crooked sometimes- he says that has never happened before.

No one else in the factory has reported anything similar.""

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/epclg) is a link to the photos.

Any ideas?

Thanks in advance.",13,"Based on the symptoms described, here are some possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible Medical Conditions:

1. **Vasculitis**: The bilateral erythematous discoloration of the superficial anterior vasculature of the forearms, which is progressing medially, could be indicative of vasculitis, an inflammation of the blood vessels.
2. **Thrombophlebitis**: The discoloration and palpatable vasculature could also suggest thrombophlebitis, a blood clot in a vein.
3. **Raynaud's phenomenon**: The discoloration and cold-induced symptoms (freezer burn) might be related to Raynaud's phenomenon, a condition that affects blood flow to the fingers and toes.
4. **Arthritis**: The swollen tarsal joints and tendinitis could be indicative of an underlying arthritic condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis.
5. **Scurvy**: Although less likely, the symptoms could be related to scurvy, a disease caused by vitamin C deficiency, which can cause joint pain, swelling, and skin discoloration.

Recommended Diagnostic Tests or Evaluations:

1. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: To rule out underlying infections or inflammatory conditions.
2. **Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP)**: To assess for inflammation and potential vasculitis.
3. **Blood coagulation tests**: To evaluate for thrombophlebitis or other coagulation disorders.
4. **Vitamin C and other nutrient levels**: To assess for scurvy or other nutritional deficiencies.
5. **Imaging studies**: Ultrasound or Doppler studies of the affected veins to evaluate for thrombophlebitis or other vascular abnormalities.
6. **Rheumatologic evaluation**: To assess for underlying arthritic conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis.
7. **Physical examination**: A thorough physical examination to evaluate the extent of the vasculature discoloration and joint symptoms.
8. **Medical history**: A detailed medical history to identify potential underlying conditions or exposures that may be contributing to the symptoms.

Justifications:

* The CBC, ESR, and CRP tests are recommended to rule out underlying infections or inflammatory conditions that may be contributing to the symptoms.
* Blood coagulation tests are recommended to evaluate for thrombophlebitis or other coagulation disorders that may be causing the vasculature discoloration.
* Vitamin C and other nutrient levels are recommended to assess for scurvy or other nutritional deficiencies that may be contributing to the symptoms.
* Imaging studies are recommended to evaluate for thrombophlebitis or other vascular abnormalities that may be causing the vasculature discoloration.
* A rheumatologic evaluation is recommended to assess for underlying arthritic conditions that may be contributing to the joint symptoms.
* A physical examination and medical history are essential to evaluate the extent of the symptoms and identify potential underlying conditions or exposures that may be contributing to the symptoms.

It is essential to note that these recommendations are based on the information provided and may not be comprehensive. A thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary to determine the underlying cause of the symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan."

 ",13,"I'm troubled to hear about your girlfriend's condition, and I'll do my best to provide some guidance. Based on the symptoms you've described, here are some possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible Medical Conditions:
1. **Stroke or Cerebral Vasculature Accident (CVA)**: Given the sudden onset of seizure, loss of speech, limited mobility, and loss of sensitivity on one side of the body, a stroke is a strong possibility.
2. **Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)**: If there was any head trauma before the seizure, TBI could be a consideration.
3. **Brain Tumor**: Although less likely, a brain tumor could cause seizures and neurological deficits, especially if it's located in a critical area.
4. **Infectious or Inflammatory Conditions**: Such as meningitis, encephalitis, or abscess, which could cause seizures and altered mental status.
5. **Status Epilepticus**: Prolonged or recurrent seizures without full recovery in between.

Recommended Diagnostic Tests or Evaluations:
1. **Immediate Neurological Examination**: A thorough neurological exam to assess the extent of the deficits and to look for any signs of worsening.
2. **CT or MRI of the Brain**: If not already done, to evaluate for stroke, tumor, or other structural abnormalities. The resonance study you mentioned might be an MRI, but without a radiologist's interpretation, it's difficult to say.
3. **Electroencephalogram (EEG)**: To evaluate for seizure activity and to assess the risk of further seizures.
4. **Blood Tests**: To check for signs of infection (e.g., complete blood count, blood cultures), metabolic disorders (e.g., electrolyte panel, glucose), and to evaluate liver and kidney function.
5. **Lumbar Puncture (LP)**: If there's suspicion of an infectious or inflammatory condition, such as meningitis or encephalitis, an LP might be necessary to analyze cerebrospinal fluid.
6. **Consultation with a Neurologist**: As soon as possible, to guide further management and to interpret the resonance study (likely an MRI) you've mentioned.

Justifications:
- The combination of seizure, loss of speech, and hemiparesis (weakness on one side of the body) suggests a significant neurological event, such as a stroke, which requires immediate attention.
- The ongoing pain and altered mental status (sleepiness) could indicate ongoing seizure activity, infection, or another serious condition that needs prompt evaluation.
- The lack of access to specialized care, including a radiologist to interpret the MRI, necessitates seeking out any available medical expertise as soon as possible.

Given your situation, it might be beneficial to try and contact international medical organizations or telemedicine services that could provide immediate consultation and guidance. Additionally, preparing all available medical information, including the MRI study, for review by a specialist on Monday could help expedite her care."
My doctor prescribed me a cream and said he would call it in and it would have to be mailed to me. A lot of weirdness ensued. Something seems really strange about this.,"I went to an orthopedic doctor (legit MD) for a pain in my shoulder.  Impingement syndrome / rotator cuff sprain.  It was my first visit for the issue.

I got a steroid injection, physical therapy orders, and he told me he was going to prescribe a cream.  He said it's for general muscle relief.  I said, ""like tiger balm?"" and he replied ""no, this is a prescription drug, it's medicated"".  He said I can't pick it up at a pharmacy and that his pharmacy will mail it to me.  I thought this was a little strange.

That pharmacy called me a day later and asked for my insurance information.  I gave it to them and asked for the name of the drug so I could research what it was (I was a little skepical/suspicious at this point that the doctor was trying to sell me something).  The lady at the pharmacy said it's ""just orthopedic cream"" .. that's it.  It has no name.  I'm puzzled at this point.

Today, a few days later, I get a package in the mail, it's my cream.  I call the pharmacy and tell them I did not ask for this and that I did not want it.  I hadn't opened the package yet and asked her ""is there a bill inside?  I never paid for this and do not intend to"".. and she said ""I don't know, open it and see.  You don't have to pay for it if you don't want to"".   She later asked me if doctor put me in a research program for the drug.  Excuse me, what?

The bottle had an Rx label on it, but no drug names, no information sheet, no warnings.   Sure enough, it just says ""orthopedic cream"".  It says it's a compound drug.  I did some research and found that compound drugs are a legitimate thing, though not regulated by the FDA.  So at least I now know why it has no name.  But I also found that doctors should only prescribe compound drugs custom tailored to the patient's specific needs.  This was not the case, it was a very generic offer in the doctor's office.  He just said (paraphrasing) ""I'll write you up for a prescription for a cream, it's great for soreness and muscle pain"".  

Am I reading into this too much or does something sound really fishy about this?

Doctor tells me it's a prescription.  I didn't pay a copay.  I didn't have to pay for the medicine, nor do they care if I do.  My doctor had to call it in and have it shipped to me.  Pharmacy asks me if I'm in a research program.  No description of the drugs inside the ""compound"".  I'm at a loss.  Nothing about any of this is adding up.

Any idea what's going on here?  
",11,"Based on the symptoms and the unusual experience with the doctor and pharmacy, possible medical conditions related to the initial complaint are:

1. **Impingement syndrome**: The doctor's initial diagnosis, which may require further evaluation to confirm.
2. **Rotator cuff sprain**: Another possible condition that may be causing the shoulder pain.
3. **Musculoskeletal pain**: A broader category that encompasses various types of muscle and joint pain.

However, the unusual experience with the doctor and pharmacy raises concerns about potential issues unrelated to the initial medical condition. Possible explanations include:

1. **Questionable business practices**: The doctor and pharmacy may be involved in a scheme to sell unnecessary or unapproved medications, potentially for financial gain.
2. **Lack of transparency**: The absence of clear information about the medication, including its name, ingredients, and potential side effects, is concerning.
3. **Potential research program**: The pharmacy's question about a research program suggests that the medication may be part of an unapproved or experimental study.

To address these concerns, the following diagnostic tests or evaluations are recommended:

1. **Second opinion**: Consult with another orthopedic doctor to confirm the initial diagnosis and discuss alternative treatment options.
2. **Medication investigation**: Research the pharmacy and the medication further to determine if it is a legitimate, FDA-approved compound or if it is part of an unapproved study.
3. **Report to authorities**: Consider reporting the incident to the relevant medical boards, FDA, or other regulatory agencies to investigate potential wrongdoing.
4. **Review of medical records**: Request a copy of the medical records from the initial doctor's visit to ensure that all information is accurate and complete.
5. **Patient advocacy**: Seek guidance from a patient advocacy organization or a medical professional to help navigate the situation and ensure that the patient's rights are protected.

Justifications for these recommendations include:

* The need for a second opinion to confirm the diagnosis and ensure that the treatment plan is appropriate.
* The importance of investigating the medication and pharmacy to determine if they are operating within legal and ethical boundaries.
* The potential need to report the incident to regulatory agencies to prevent harm to other patients.
* The importance of reviewing medical records to ensure accuracy and completeness.
* The need for patient advocacy to protect the patient's rights and interests."
Fell on Stump Post-op BKA. Complications. Should I seek a wound care specialist?,"Two weeks post-op everything was fine.  I had half of the staples removed and was told I could return to normal activity.  This is what my leg looked like shortly before the first half of the [staples were removed](http://i.imgur.com/RAwWXZS).

The next morning, Friday July 25th, I fell getting out of the tub.  Landed on hard tile with the end of my residual limb.  I didn't get a picture of it until I unbandaged it the next [Tuesday July 29th](http://i.imgur.com/7jWYiSm) because the pain was growing out of control.  I had called my Doc's PA the morning of my fall and left a voicemail for her.  I explained that it hurt pretty bad, that the nerves were going crazy, and that I felt like it had pulled apart somewhat.  I followed this up with a text message a bit later and finally spoke with her some time after 1PM.  I went further into detail with her, answered her questions about the presence of leaking fluids (which I couldn't answer conclusively), and then suggested that I had an appointment later that day with the VA Primary Care Doc.  Was told she wouldn't know what the wound would look like.  I was ok with that, but I was still going to see if she saw something obvious.  Anyhow, the gist of that is the PA told me to wait until I was scheduled to see the Doc 5 days later on July 30th.  She didn't seem concerned.

July 30th appointment is the first one I was having directly with my Doctor in a while, and of course the first one since my fall.  I had my bandage removed by a nurse and waited for him to come in.  When he did, [he took one look](http://i.imgur.com/baJ56Bs) then asked me ""Have you been up more than you should?""  I found that to be an odd question.  I had been told to return to normal activity last Thursday, then fell on Friday and reported that to his staff.  So, that's kind of how I responded: ""Not really.  In fact, I've been down a lot more since the fall.""  Before I even finished getting ""fall"" out of my mouth, the stoic surgeon's face became a bit pallid and he turned toward me with his eyes a little wider than usual.  I was given the impression that he was not made aware that I had fallen and contacted his own PA about said fall 5 days earlier.  I let him know exactly what I told the PA, he asked why I didn't come in immediately, I told him what I was told by his PA, and we wrapped up the conversation with him scolding me to be more direct and bold when contacting his staff in need of assistance.

It is left alone for the next 3 appointments (every other day) until this last appointment, August 6th.  This time, the PA is seeing me for the first time since the fall.  I had felt she might have gotten in trouble for not informing the doctor, but apparently she was back in his good graces.  She sits down and kinda looks aghast at the [wound](http://i.imgur.com/fktqnFQ).  

She starts playing a bit coy, asking me if this was from the first fall when I talked to her or the second.  I was immediately put on guard by this.  I never have fallen again, and I definitely never told anyone that I had.  That's what I told her at this time.  She then continues like this: ""Well, what about when you called Alex on Monday?""  What?  I didn't call anyone on Monday.  I did call Tuesday night and spoke with the Doc because I was running a fever, having a hard time breathing, and was in a lot of pain.  When I made that call, I thought he knew about the fall.  He kinda brushed me off, so again I thought nothing of their instructions or of my injury.  He did at least tell me to come in at 8AM the next day, July 30th.  

The probings continued like this for a few more minutes.  It felt to me like she had gotten into trouble and was either trying to find out what I told the Doc or try to redirect the blame from herself entirely.  I was very forceful and direct by letting her know that this was from the fall I called her about, that I thought she should have had me come in immediately and apparently the doctor did as well, and that I didn't take kindly to her not-so-subtle shifty questions and in some cases flat out lies.

So, with all of that and the pictures of the wound (the last one being the most current), would it be wise for me to get a second opinion from another ortho doc or perhaps a wound care specialist?  Seeing this wound immediately [after I fell on it](http://i.imgur.com/7jWYiSm), could a doctor perhaps have done something more to prevent [this?](http://i.imgur.com/fktqnFQ)

Thanks for your time.",11,"Based on the symptoms and the events described, possible medical conditions that may be considered include:

1. **Wound dehiscence**: The wound appears to have reopened, and the presence of a significant gap between the edges of the wound suggests that the wound may have dehisced.
2. **Infection**: The increasing pain, redness, and swelling around the wound, as well as the presence of a fever, suggest that an infection may be present.
3. **Nerve damage**: The patient reports ""nerves going crazy"" and significant pain, which could indicate nerve damage or irritation.
4. **Delayed healing**: The wound does not appear to be healing as expected, which could be due to various factors such as infection, poor circulation, or inadequate wound care.

Recommended next diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Wound culture**: To determine if an infection is present and to identify the causative organism.
2. **Imaging studies**: X-rays or other imaging modalities to assess the underlying bone and soft tissue for any signs of complications such as osteomyelitis or abscess formation.
3. **Nerve conduction studies**: To evaluate the function of the nerves in the affected area and to determine if there is any nerve damage.
4. **Vascular studies**: To assess blood flow to the affected area and to determine if there are any circulatory issues that may be contributing to delayed healing.

Given the concerns about the management of the wound and the communication issues with the current healthcare team, it would be wise to seek a second opinion from:

1. **Another orthopedic surgeon**: To evaluate the wound and provide an independent assessment of the management plan.
2. **A wound care specialist**: To provide expertise in wound management and to develop a plan to promote healing and prevent further complications.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* The patient has experienced a significant setback in their recovery, and a second opinion can provide an independent assessment of the situation and help to identify any potential issues with the current management plan.
* The communication issues with the current healthcare team, including the lack of concern shown by the PA and the doctor's apparent surprise at the patient's fall, suggest that a fresh perspective may be beneficial.
* A wound care specialist can provide expertise in wound management and help to develop a plan to promote healing and prevent further complications.
* An orthopedic surgeon can evaluate the wound and provide an assessment of the underlying bone and soft tissue, as well as recommend any necessary interventions to promote healing and prevent further complications."
How do I report a Dr. who is pushing pills?,"Hello /r/AskDocs,

My question is: what's the best way to report a doctor and have him investigated for running a pill mill? 

I figured doctors would know the protocol, so I'm asking this here. In case you're wondering why I'd make such an allegation, I've provided a bit of background below. Thank you for your time.


I visited a doctor about a year ago to establish myself as a patient. I had no health problems, and I was only there because my family's physician had moved and I had to find a new GP. The actual visit with him lasted five minutes only and at the end he handed me a prescription for both Percocet and Vicodin with refills. I immediately gave it back and found another doctor, for I had explicitly told him I did not have any kind of pain when he'd asked. 

I live in a small community in HI, and I've noticed changes in many of my friends who are his patients. They've become lethargic, withdrawn, and out of shape.

A member of my household is also seeing this doctor and I've noticed tremendous physical and emotional changes in this person while they have been under the doctor's care as well, about 18 months. I discovered today that this household member had been prescribed (by said doctor) an outrageous amount of narcotics: 6 pills a day of 5mg oxycodone - 350mg acetaminophen tablets, to be taken every day and refilled each month. This person's medical record states they've had a long history of pill addiction (oxycodone) as well as myasthenia gravis (not sure if that's a relevant condition, but I'm including it because I suspect it may be). This is what compels me, above all, to report this doctor. 

So, what can I do? This seems horribly illegal and unethical to me. I fear for the wellbeing of my friend and for the well-being of my community.",11,"Based on the symptoms and concerns described, possible medical conditions that may be relevant to the situation include:

1. **Opioid use disorder**: The household member's history of pill addiction and current prescription for a large amount of narcotics raises concerns about potential opioid misuse or dependence.
2. **Myasthenia gravis**: This chronic autoimmune disorder may be relevant to the household member's medical history and current treatment, although it is not directly related to the concerns about the doctor's prescribing practices.
3. **Iatrogenic addiction**: The doctor's alleged over-prescription of narcotics may be contributing to the development of addiction in patients, including the household member.
4. **Pill mill operation**: The doctor's practices, as described, may be indicative of a pill mill operation, where a healthcare provider inappropriately prescribes controlled substances for financial gain.

To address these concerns, the following diagnostic tests or evaluations may be recommended:

1. **Medical record review**: A thorough review of the household member's medical record, as well as those of other patients who have been prescribed narcotics by the doctor, to assess the appropriateness of prescribing practices.
2. **Toxicology screening**: Urine or blood tests to detect the presence of narcotics or other substances in the household member's system, which can help assess the risk of opioid misuse or dependence.
3. **Psychological evaluation**: A comprehensive psychological evaluation of the household member to assess their mental health and potential risk factors for addiction.
4. **Investigation by regulatory agencies**: Reporting the concerns to regulatory agencies, such as the state medical board or the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), to investigate the doctor's prescribing practices and potential pill mill operation.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* A medical record review can help identify patterns of inappropriate prescribing practices and assess the doctor's adherence to medical standards.
* Toxicology screening can provide objective evidence of narcotic use and help assess the risk of addiction.
* A psychological evaluation can help identify underlying mental health issues that may be contributing to the household member's behavior and assess their risk factors for addiction.
* Reporting the concerns to regulatory agencies can help ensure that the doctor's practices are investigated and addressed, and that patients are protected from potential harm.

To report the doctor and have them investigated, the following steps can be taken:

1. **Contact the state medical board**: File a complaint with the state medical board, providing detailed information about the concerns and evidence of inappropriate prescribing practices.
2. **Contact the DEA**: Report the concerns to the DEA, which can investigate potential pill mill operations and take enforcement action.
3. **Contact local law enforcement**: Report the concerns to local law enforcement, which can investigate potential criminal activity and take action to protect public health and safety.
4. **Seek support from a patient advocacy organization**: Organizations such as the National Patient Advocate Foundation or the American Medical Association (AMA) may be able to provide guidance and support in reporting concerns and advocating for patient safety."

I recently had a cystoscopy to diagnose some microscopic (intermittently macroscopic) hematuria. Results showed BPH and some inflammation between bladder and prostate (or like touching the two). The doctor presumed it was prostatitis and prescribed bactrim.

The next day I got a 103 fever with a 110 average heart rate.  They promptly started treating me with Rocephin IV and some tylenol/motrin to get my fever down. The next day my fever came right back toward the end of the day and they prescribed Cefdinir to take by pill, while continuing to figure out what's going on with the urine. 

Urine culture comes back: Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. Likely prostatitis as well but this is a urinary tract infection. Doctor also believes I had transient bacteremia. All the tests were negative except white blood cell count showing 22000. I was having pain in my lower back and when I flexed my kegel muscles and a bit while urinating, but I don't seem to have urinary obstruction.

They prescribed ciprofloxacin because that's one of the things it was sensitive against, and everything else was IV/IM only.

I took that for a day and a half before what seems to be developing tendon issues. I told them I didn't want to be on cipro anymore because it feels like it's going to make me a cripple. Two days after stopping it now and I feel like I cannot run. 

My temperature/heartrate have been stable and lower the last few days but the doctors are urging me to take something. 

They sent out another urine culture to see if Suprax will be effective against pseudomonas, and are recommending me take that in the meantime while that comes back, with the risk that the pseudomonas infection could progress. 

What do I do in this situation? It seems impossible. 

One problem we're having is that I have GAD and known somatization disorder so they're not convinced the Cipro is causing the symptoms I'm feeling but I'm convinced. They don't know how to prove whether it's one way or the other without an achilles tendon biopsy but they believe that's it's own mess that isn't worth getting into.

I live in Washington State. ",11,"Based on the symptoms and medical history, possible medical conditions include:

1. **Prostatitis**: The patient's symptoms, such as pain in the lower abdomen, perineum, and penis, are consistent with prostatitis, which is an inflammation of the prostate gland.
2. **Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)**: The presence of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa in the urine culture confirms a UTI.
3. **Transient Bacteremia**: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible transient bacteremia.
4. **Tendinopathy or Tendonitis**: The patient's symptoms of tendon issues, such as pain and limited mobility, may be related to the use of ciprofloxacin, which is known to cause tendon problems in some individuals.

Recommended next diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Repeat Urine Culture**: To confirm the effectiveness of the current treatment and to monitor for any changes in the bacterial culture.
2. **Imaging Studies**: A pelvic ultrasound or CT scan may be ordered to evaluate the prostate gland and surrounding tissues for any signs of inflammation or infection.
3. **Tendon Ultrasound or MRI**: To evaluate the tendons for any signs of tendinopathy or tendonitis, which may be related to the use of ciprofloxacin.
4. **Psychological Evaluation**: Given the patient's history of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Somatization Disorder, a psychological evaluation may be helpful to assess the patient's mental state and to rule out any potential psychological contributions to the patient's symptoms.

Treatment recommendations:

1. **Alternative Antibiotics**: Consider alternative antibiotics that are effective against Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, such as Suprax (cefixime), as recommended by the doctor.
2. **Tendon Support**: Provide tendon support and physical therapy to help manage tendon symptoms and prevent further injury.
3. **Pain Management**: Manage pain with alternative medications, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, to avoid further complications.
4. **Counseling**: Consider counseling to address the patient's GAD and Somatization Disorder, which may be contributing to the patient's symptoms and concerns.

Justifications:

* The patient's symptoms and medical history suggest a complex condition that requires a comprehensive approach.
* The use of ciprofloxacin has been associated with tendon problems, and the patient's symptoms are consistent with tendinopathy or tendonitis.
* Alternative antibiotics, such as Suprax, may be effective against Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and may be a better option for the patient.
* Tendon support and physical therapy can help manage tendon symptoms and prevent further injury.
* Counseling can help address the patient's GAD and Somatization Disorder, which may be contributing to the patient's symptoms and concerns.

In Washington State, the patient may want to consider seeking a second opinion from a specialist, such as a urologist or an infectious disease specialist, to confirm the diagnosis and treatment plan. Additionally, the patient may want to consider seeking support from a mental health professional to address any underlying psychological concerns."
READ BEFORE POSTING!,"Hello!

If you are going to post here with a question, please keep a few things in mind:

**1.** The doctors on here cannot legally offer medical advice, ex. ""Get this kind of surgery done for this,"" etc. They can only try to diagnose you, tell you what you can do on your own (ex. don't do pushups for a week,) tell you if you need to see a doctor and what kind, what symptoms to look out for, and answer general inquiries regarding health.

**2.** The doctors on this subreddit cannot be held legally liable for anything. Although they are not giving medical advice, don't try to somehow twist words around and try to get them in legal trouble. They're just here to help.

**3.** A response is not 100% certain. I personally message all the doctors when somebody makes a post, but reddit is the only form of contact I have with them. So, don't guarantee an answer (although at the current size of this subreddit, I'm about 100% sure you'll get an answer.)

A Doctor is falsifying notes excusing my children from school - HELP,"I am VERY sorry if this is not the right place for this question, but I am panicking.


TL/DR – My ex-wife’s “friend” is a General Practitioner and he is writing Doctor’s Notes for the kids because she doesn’t take them to school and lets them sit around the house doing nothing all day.


My ex-wife is a pill popping, near-do-well who used to work at a Doctor’s Office doing check ins. We have 50-50 custody of the 2 kids, and she has a horrible habit of not taking the kids to school or bringing them in tardy. It has gotten to the point where we had to go meet with the school Administrators because they were threatening to send us to Juvenile Court over the number of unexcused absences and tardies. NONE of these have taken place on my weeks (I have gone back with their log and the custody schedule to validate this).


Well what has happened now is that she will keep the kids home when they don’t feel like going or she doesn’t feel like getting out of bed, then she will go to her old boss and have him wrote them a note. School is happy because all they really want is the absence to be excused (the teachers are NOT happy because they want the kids to be there to learn).


Do I have any recourse? I am thinking I might call him up and have a chat and explain that if he does this again I will file a complaint with the AMA. I don’t want to, but I have tried everything to get her to grow up and be a responsible parent and she simply will not listen to me. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I am at my wits end.  
",10,"Based on the symptoms described, it appears that the issue is not a medical condition, but rather a family law and parenting concern. However, I will provide some possible related conditions and recommendations for diagnostic tests or evaluations that a doctor might order if the situation were to be considered from a medical perspective:

Possible medical conditions:

1. **Factitious disorder imposed on another (FDIA)**: This condition, also known as Munchausen syndrome by proxy, is a form of child abuse in which a caregiver fabricates or exaggerates a child's illness for attention and sympathy. In this case, the ex-wife's behavior of keeping the kids home and obtaining doctor's notes could be a manifestation of this condition.
2. **Parental neglect**: The ex-wife's lack of responsibility in ensuring the kids attend school and her reliance on doctor's notes could be indicative of parental neglect.
3. **Substance abuse**: The ex-wife's history of ""pill popping"" suggests potential substance abuse issues, which could be contributing to her neglectful behavior.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Psychological evaluation**: A psychologist or psychiatrist could evaluate the ex-wife to assess her mental health and potential underlying conditions that may be contributing to her behavior.
2. **Substance abuse screening**: A substance abuse screening could help determine if the ex-wife's behavior is related to substance abuse issues.
3. **Child welfare assessment**: A child welfare assessment could evaluate the kids' well-being and determine if they are at risk of neglect or abuse.
4. **Family therapy**: Family therapy could help address the underlying issues and improve communication between the parents and the kids.
5. **Custody evaluation**: A custody evaluation could assess the parents' ability to provide a stable and supportive environment for the kids and potentially lead to a modification of the custody arrangement.

Justifications for each recommendation:

* A psychological evaluation could help identify underlying mental health issues that may be contributing to the ex-wife's behavior.
* Substance abuse screening could determine if substance abuse is a factor in the ex-wife's neglectful behavior.
* A child welfare assessment could ensure the kids' safety and well-being.
* Family therapy could improve communication and address underlying issues.
* A custody evaluation could lead to a modification of the custody arrangement, potentially providing a more stable environment for the kids.

It is essential to note that these recommendations are not directly related to the initial question, which is more focused on family law and parenting concerns. The primary course of action should be to address the issue through legal and educational channels, rather than medical evaluations."
I have the high taste of iron recently when I eat certain things and apparently I have been emanating a smell of it too,"So like ti says in the title I have had the taste of Iron in my mouth when I tasted both mash potatoes and then today salsa. When I sat next to my mom I apparently had the smell of Iron too. I think it may be related but i am  not completely sure.Also I am almost 16 Male about 5'5"" ish maybe a bit taller around 140 -150 pounds white though have some mixed heritage awhile back(also some seam which is apparently why I have asianish eyes) and I live in Coronado,california and I am not taking any medicine but I do/had childhood epilepsy.",10,"Based on the symptoms described, here are possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible Medical Conditions:

1. **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: The taste of iron in the mouth, especially after consuming certain foods, could be a sign of gastrointestinal bleeding. The smell of iron on the patient's breath (halitosis) also supports this possibility.
2. **Hemochromatosis**: This genetic disorder causes the body to absorb too much iron from food, leading to iron overload. The patient's mixed heritage and childhood epilepsy (which may be related to iron metabolism) make this condition a possibility.
3. **Gingivitis or periodontal disease**: Poor oral health can cause bleeding gums, leading to a metallic taste and smell.
4. **Sinusitis or upper respiratory infection**: Infections in the sinuses or upper respiratory tract can cause a metallic taste and smell.
5. **Medication side effect (unlikely)**: Although the patient is not taking any medication, it's possible that a previous medication or supplement could be causing the symptoms.

Recommended Diagnostic Tests or Evaluations:

1. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: To check for anemia, bleeding disorders, or infection.
2. **Iron level tests**: To assess iron levels in the blood and rule out hemochromatosis or iron deficiency.
3. **Gastrointestinal evaluation**: Upper endoscopy or colonoscopy to investigate gastrointestinal bleeding or other abnormalities.
4. **Dental examination**: To evaluate oral health and rule out gingivitis or periodontal disease.
5. **Sinus or upper respiratory evaluation**: To assess for sinusitis or upper respiratory infections.
6. **Physical examination**: To check for any signs of bleeding, anemia, or other underlying conditions.
7. **Medical history review**: To investigate any potential connections between childhood epilepsy and current symptoms.
8. **Genetic testing**: If hemochromatosis is suspected, genetic testing may be recommended to confirm the diagnosis.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* The combination of metallic taste and smell, especially after consuming certain foods, suggests a possible gastrointestinal or oral health issue.
* The patient's mixed heritage and childhood epilepsy may be related to iron metabolism, making hemochromatosis a possibility.
* A thorough medical history review and physical examination can help identify any underlying conditions or potential causes of the symptoms.
* Diagnostic tests, such as CBC, iron level tests, and gastrointestinal evaluation, can help rule out or confirm potential medical conditions."
I have a serious case of brain fog. My cognitive functions are declining. Please help :(,"Hi,
I feel like in the past two to three years my cognitive skills have considerably declined. I mean I am not as smart as i used to. I am not sure what to in this situation. Please help. 


Here are my symptoms:

1. Problems take way longer to solve than before. I have become really bad at math too.
2. If I read something, it is really hard for me to comprehend. I used to be able to read my books once or twice and grasp the concept.
3. My language skills have declined considerably. (Poor vocabulary, very bad spelling- spelling can be attributed to always using spell check. but i find myself typing stupid spellings for even simple words like ""there"" and realizing and retyping)
4. Bad memory. (but I was always like that)
5. Cant focus on anything. My concentration is really bad. This is the biggest problem I have right now. I am not able to study.
6. I can literally feel a mental fog. 


About me:
28 years old. Male. 5'5''. 135 pounds. Indian living in US.  Computer programmer. 
No medications. Drinks rarely. Smokes about two cigarettes a day. Late sleeper. Eats reasonably healthy. Works out (started 3 months ago) 4 days a week. 

If I should see a doctor, please advice on what kind of doctor to see. I have never been to a doctor in US and I`m quite clueless on the healthcare system here.I do have insurance from work even-though I don't know know how use it.",10,"Based on your symptoms, here are some possible medical conditions that may be contributing to your cognitive decline:

1. **Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)**: Your difficulty with focus, concentration, and mental fog could be indicative of ADHD.
2. **Depression**: Cognitive impairment, including problems with memory, attention, and language skills, can be a symptom of depression.
3. **Anxiety Disorder**: Excessive anxiety can impair cognitive function, leading to difficulties with focus, concentration, and mental clarity.
4. **Sleep Disorder**: Your self-described ""late sleeper"" habit could be contributing to your cognitive decline, as sleep deprivation can significantly impact cognitive function.
5. **Vitamin Deficiency**: Deficiencies in vitamins such as B12, D, or iron can cause cognitive impairment, fatigue, and difficulty with concentration.
6. **Hypothyroidism**: An underactive thyroid gland can cause cognitive symptoms such as memory loss, difficulty with concentration, and mental fogginess.
7. **Chronic Stress**: Prolonged stress can impair cognitive function, leading to difficulties with focus, concentration, and mental clarity.

To further evaluate your symptoms, I recommend the following diagnostic tests and evaluations:

1. **Primary Care Physician (PCP) Visit**: Start by scheduling an appointment with a PCP, who can perform a thorough medical history, physical examination, and initial evaluation of your symptoms.
2. **Cognitive Function Tests**: Your PCP may refer you to a neurologist or psychologist for cognitive function tests, such as:
	* Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)
	* Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)
	* Trail Making Test (TMT)
3. **Blood Tests**: To rule out underlying medical conditions, your PCP may order blood tests to check for:
	* Vitamin B12, D, and iron levels
	* Thyroid function (TSH, free T4, and free T3)
	* Complete Blood Count (CBC) to evaluate for anemia or other blood disorders
4. **Sleep Study**: If your PCP suspects a sleep disorder, they may refer you to a sleep specialist for a sleep study to evaluate your sleep patterns.
5. **Psychological Evaluation**: A psychologist or psychiatrist can assess your mental health and evaluate for conditions such as depression, anxiety, or ADHD.

As you have insurance from work, you can start by:

1. Contacting your insurance provider to understand your coverage and network of doctors.
2. Asking your HR department for guidance on how to use your insurance.
3. Searching for PCPs in your network and scheduling an appointment.
4. Being prepared to provide detailed information about your symptoms, medical history, and lifestyle habits during your doctor's visit.

Remember to ask questions and seek clarification on any concerns you may have during your doctor's visit."
Blood &amp; tufts of hair in my navel,"Hello,
   I am overweight but not severely obese (6'3, 225 male).  Even so, I have a rather deep navel.  Always have.

Every now and then there's a liquid discharge from my navel, smells bad.  It's usually clear, sometimes tinged with blood.  It isn't pus.  I remove this with cotton swabs and alcohol, but it never completely goes away until I eventually dig out a little tuft of hair.

This is rather strange.  It's almost about half an inch of tightly packed strands of hair.  There are a lot of them, but there's never any visible root.  I don't have to yank this hair out either.  It isn't attached.  It just eventually slides out of my navel with the cotton swab.  

Once this hair tuft is removed, the bleeding and discharge go away within a day or so.  Until it happens again, usually a few months later.  I try to keep a clean Navel.  I wash and dry it every day.  

[Here's a picture of the hair](http://postimg.org/image/uhqpkgx6n/)

What's going on with me, and how do I best prevent it?  ",10,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be causing the issue include:

1. **Navel stone or omphalolith**: A small, hard mass of dead skin cells and other debris that can accumulate in the navel and cause discharge, odor, and occasional bleeding.
2. **Pilonidal sinus**: A small tunnel or pit in the skin that can become clogged with hair and debris, leading to discharge, odor, and occasional bleeding.
3. **Navel cyst or abscess**: A fluid-filled sac or pocket of pus that can form in the navel, causing discharge, odor, and occasional bleeding.
4. **Dermoid cyst**: A type of cyst that can form in the navel and contain hair, skin, and other tissue, leading to discharge, odor, and occasional bleeding.

To further diagnose and evaluate the condition, the following tests or evaluations may be recommended:

1. **Physical examination**: A thorough examination of the navel and surrounding area to look for any signs of infection, inflammation, or other abnormalities.
2. **Ultrasound or CT scan**: Imaging tests to visualize the navel and surrounding tissue, which can help identify any underlying cysts, sinuses, or other abnormalities.
3. **Biopsy**: A sample of tissue from the navel may be taken and examined under a microscope to rule out any underlying conditions, such as a dermoid cyst.
4. **Culture and sensitivity testing**: A sample of the discharge may be sent to a laboratory to check for any bacterial or fungal infections.
5. **Navel endoscopy**: A small, flexible tube with a camera and light on the end may be inserted into the navel to visualize the inside of the navel and surrounding tissue.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* A physical examination is necessary to assess the navel and surrounding area for any signs of infection or inflammation.
* Imaging tests, such as ultrasound or CT scans, can help identify any underlying cysts, sinuses, or other abnormalities that may be causing the symptoms.
* A biopsy may be necessary to rule out any underlying conditions, such as a dermoid cyst, which can contain hair and other tissue.
* Culture and sensitivity testing can help identify any bacterial or fungal infections that may be contributing to the symptoms.
* Navel endoscopy can provide a detailed view of the inside of the navel and surrounding tissue, which can help diagnose any underlying conditions, such as a pilonidal sinus.

To prevent future episodes, the following measures may be recommended:

1. **Keep the navel clean and dry**: Regular washing and drying of the navel can help prevent the accumulation of debris and reduce the risk of infection.
2. **Avoid tight clothing**: Tight clothing can irritate the navel and surrounding skin, which can exacerbate the symptoms.
3. **Avoid digging or probing the navel**: Avoid inserting objects, such as cotton swabs, into the navel, as this can push debris and bacteria further into the navel and surrounding tissue.
4. **Consider surgical removal of any underlying cysts or sinuses**: If an underlying cyst or sinus is identified, surgical removal may be necessary to prevent future episodes."
"23m, recently diagnosed with a mild aortic aneurysm, but I really would like to just get the operation over with sooner rather than later. Thoughts/advice?","First off, I am a 23-year-old white male, 5'7"" and approx. 155 lbs.  Prior to my diagnosis, I exercised very regularly, including weight lifting and HIIT and even now try to see some form of exercise at least once a day, be it a light jog, a walk, or some light weight lifting.

I was recently diagnosed with an ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm at the beginning of the summer.  The aneurysm is concurrent with a bicuspid valve.  When I was originally diagnosed, I was told I would have to watch my heart rate and blood pressure, and while I could go back to exercising I could never go as intense as I have been.  I was also told to avoid other activities which may increase heart rate, such as roller coasters.  When I asked about an operation, the doctor told me that, while the surgery would replace my valve and bring my aorta basically back to square one and has a 2% mishap rate, he wouldn't recommend it until it grew to an alarming size (I think mine is currently at about a 4.5 mm).

But I've been thinking about it, and though it'd be open heart surgery I really don't want to wait till I'm fifty to get this fixed.  I think I would recover quicker at my age, and, hell, I want to enjoy my age.  I don't want to have to be tied down by this thing, especially if a surgery can offer a permanent fix.

What advice can y'all offer me?  Should I cool my heels?  Or do you think I should get a second opinion on a possible surgery?",10,"Based on the symptoms and diagnosis, possible medical conditions related to the ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm and bicuspid valve include:

1. **Aortic dissection or rupture**: A life-threatening condition where the aorta tears or ruptures, which can be fatal if not treated promptly.
2. **Aortic regurgitation**: A condition where the bicuspid valve leaks, causing blood to flow back into the heart, leading to heart failure or other complications.
3. **Hypertension**: High blood pressure, which can increase the risk of aortic dissection or rupture.
4. **Cardiac arrhythmias**: Abnormal heart rhythms, which can be caused by the bicuspid valve or aortic aneurysm.

Recommended next diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Echocardiogram**: A regular echocardiogram to monitor the size of the aneurysm and the function of the bicuspid valve.
2. **Cardiac MRI or CT scan**: To get a more detailed image of the aorta and the aneurysm, and to monitor its growth.
3. **Blood pressure monitoring**: Regular blood pressure checks to ensure it's within a safe range.
4. **Exercise stress test**: To assess the heart's response to exercise and determine a safe exercise plan.
5. **Genetic testing**: To check for any genetic conditions that may be associated with the bicuspid valve or aortic aneurysm, such as Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

As for seeking a second opinion on possible surgery, it's highly recommended. Justifications for this include:

1. **Age and recovery**: As you mentioned, recovering from surgery at a younger age may be easier and less complicated.
2. **Risk-benefit analysis**: A second opinion can help weigh the risks and benefits of surgery, considering your individual circumstances and the size of the aneurysm.
3. **Surgical options**: A second opinion can provide more information on the different surgical options available, such as valve-sparing surgery or aortic root replacement.
4. **Expertise**: Consulting a specialist, such as a cardiothoracic surgeon or a cardiologist with expertise in aortic disease, can provide more insight into the best course of treatment.

It's essential to discuss your concerns and questions with your doctor and consider seeking a second opinion from a specialist to determine the best approach for your specific situation."
"Extreme amount of head pain, dad doesn't see the point in going to the doctors because he thinks it's just because I've been waking up late.","My head as been in an extreme amount of pain for the last 4 days. Like it hurts to stand up, look around quickly or even sometimes if I'm just sitting up. When the worst of it happens, my head starts throbbing and it feels like someone is jamming a knife into top portion of my head. I am in an extreme amount of pain right now.

Age: 18
Sex: male
Height: 6 1
Weight: 245",10,"Based on the symptoms described, here are possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible Medical Conditions:

1. **Tension Headache**: The description of throbbing pain, especially when standing up or moving quickly, could indicate a tension headache.
2. **Migraine**: The severe, stabbing pain, and lack of response to over-the-counter pain medication, may suggest a migraine.
3. **Sinusitis**: The use of Mucinex (an expectorant) and cold medicine, and the lack of relief, could indicate sinusitis, especially if there are other symptoms like nasal congestion or facial pain.
4. **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH)**: The severe headache, especially when standing up or straining, and the lack of response to pain medication, may suggest IIH, which is more common in obese individuals.
5. **Other possibilities**: Other conditions like a brain tumor, stroke, or meningitis, although less likely, cannot be ruled out without further evaluation.

Recommended Diagnostic Tests or Evaluations:

1. **Complete Medical History**: A thorough medical history to identify any underlying conditions, allergies, or previous head injuries.
2. **Physical Examination**: A comprehensive physical examination, including a neurological exam, to assess for any signs of neurological deficits or abnormalities.
3. **Imaging Studies**:
	* **CT or MRI scan**: To rule out any structural abnormalities, such as a brain tumor, stroke, or IIH.
	* **Sinus CT scan**: To evaluate for sinusitis or other sinus-related conditions.
4. **Lumbar Puncture (LP)**: If IIH or meningitis is suspected, an LP may be necessary to measure cerebrospinal fluid pressure and analyze the fluid for any abnormalities.
5. **Blood Tests**: To rule out any underlying infections, inflammatory conditions, or other systemic diseases that may be contributing to the headache.
6. **Ophthalmological Evaluation**: If the headache is accompanied by visual disturbances, an ophthalmological evaluation may be necessary to rule out any eye-related conditions.
7. **Sleep Study**: If the headache is worse in the morning or after waking up, a sleep study may be recommended to evaluate for sleep apnea or other sleep-related disorders.

Justifications:

* The patient's age, sex, and weight, as well as the severity and duration of the headache, warrant a thorough evaluation to rule out any underlying conditions that may require prompt medical attention.
* The lack of response to over-the-counter pain medication and the severity of the headache suggest that a more comprehensive evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying cause.
* The patient's height and weight, particularly the high BMI, increase the risk for IIH, which requires prompt evaluation and treatment to prevent long-term complications."
I just pooped this. [NSFW],"It was a mucusy blob with brown strings. Do i have worms? 

http://imgur.com/NnWYUjV",9,"Based on the symptoms described, here are some possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible medical conditions:
1. **Intestinal parasites (e.g., worms)**: The presence of a mucusy blob with brown strings could be indicative of an intestinal parasite infection, such as tapeworms or roundworms.
2. **Gastrointestinal infection**: The symptoms could also be related to a gastrointestinal infection, such as giardiasis or amoebiasis, which can cause changes in stool consistency and color.
3. **Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)**: Conditions like Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis can cause changes in stool, including the presence of mucus and blood.
4. **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: The brown color of the strings could be indicative of blood in the stool, which could be a sign of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:
1. **Stool test**: A stool test can help identify the presence of intestinal parasites, such as worms, or gastrointestinal infections.
2. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: A CBC can help identify any signs of infection, inflammation, or anemia, which could be related to gastrointestinal bleeding or IBD.
3. **Endoscopy or Colonoscopy**: A visual examination of the gastrointestinal tract using an endoscope or colonoscope can help identify any signs of IBD, gastrointestinal bleeding, or other abnormalities.
4. **Imaging studies (e.g., X-rays, CT scans)**: Imaging studies can help identify any signs of gastrointestinal obstruction, inflammation, or other abnormalities that could be causing the symptoms.
5. **Physical examination and medical history**: A thorough physical examination and medical history can help identify any other symptoms or risk factors that could be contributing to the condition.

Justifications:
- The symptoms described are non-specific and could be related to a variety of conditions, so a comprehensive diagnostic approach is necessary.
- Stool tests and CBCs are non-invasive and can provide valuable information about the presence of intestinal parasites or gastrointestinal infections.
- Endoscopy or colonoscopy can provide a direct visual examination of the gastrointestinal tract and help identify any signs of IBD, gastrointestinal bleeding, or other abnormalities.
- Imaging studies can help identify any signs of gastrointestinal obstruction, inflammation, or other abnormalities that could be causing the symptoms.
- A physical examination and medical history can help identify any other symptoms or risk factors that could be contributing to the condition.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation and diagnosis, as they can assess the symptoms and medical history to determine the best course of action."
What's Wrong with My Vision?,"Hi, 

Recently, I've had something extremely irritating happening with my eyes, and I'm starting to worry. Whenever I'd look at something, a white, lowly opaque wave would overwhelm my vision. The best way to describe what I see is by comparing it to seeing through dirty glasses, with fingerprint stains on the lens (these ""stains"" move around, though, similarly to how floaters would). If I were to have my eyes flicker toward one direction now, for instance, a tint of white would rush across my field of vision after a few milliseconds, and eventually move away. 

Also, this only occurs in my left eye. If I'd cover it, keep my right one open and look around, my vision wouldn't be affected by any whiteness.

It's also worth mentioning that this wave of whiteness is most prominent when looking at an area where two objects highly contrast in brightness. If I were to look at a dark surface, and immediately shift my focus to an area that's bright (e.g., a computer screen), a white wave would just LAYER my entire vision. Sometimes, I'd have to resist the instinct to flinch. Yes, it's that bad. 

I will seek help as soon as possible, but I very much want to have a brief idea of what may be happening.

Many, many thanks to those who can help :)

",9,"Based on the symptoms you've described, here are some possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible medical conditions:

1. **Vitreous detachment**: The description of a white, opaque wave moving across your vision, especially when looking at areas with high contrast in brightness, could be indicative of a vitreous detachment. This occurs when the vitreous gel in the eye separates from the retina.
2. **Posterior vitreous detachment (PVD)**: Similar to vitreous detachment, PVD is a common condition where the vitreous gel separates from the retina, causing floaters and flashes of light.
3. **Retinal tear or detachment**: The sudden appearance of a white wave in your vision, especially when looking at bright objects, could be a sign of a retinal tear or detachment.
4. **Migraine aura**: Although you didn't mention any headache symptoms, the description of a white wave moving across your vision could be similar to a migraine aura.
5. **Optic neuritis**: This condition, which affects the optic nerve, can cause visual disturbances, including flashes of light and changes in vision.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Comprehensive eye exam**: A thorough eye exam by an ophthalmologist or optometrist is essential to rule out any underlying conditions. This will include a visual acuity test, refraction test, and a detailed examination of the retina and vitreous.
2. **Slit-lamp examination**: A slit-lamp exam will allow the doctor to examine the anterior segment of the eye, including the cornea, iris, and lens, to check for any abnormalities.
3. **Fundus examination**: A fundus exam will enable the doctor to examine the retina and vitreous in detail, looking for any signs of detachment, tears, or other abnormalities.
4. **Optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan**: An OCT scan will provide a detailed image of the retina and its layers, helping to diagnose conditions such as retinal detachment or optic neuritis.
5. **Visual field test**: A visual field test will assess your peripheral vision and detect any defects or abnormalities in your field of vision.
6. **Electroretinography (ERG) or multifocal ERG**: These tests measure the electrical activity of the retina and can help diagnose conditions such as retinal detachment or optic neuritis.

Justifications for each recommendation:

* A comprehensive eye exam is essential to rule out any underlying conditions and to assess the overall health of the eye.
* A slit-lamp examination and fundus examination will allow the doctor to examine the eye in detail and check for any abnormalities.
* An OCT scan will provide a detailed image of the retina and its layers, helping to diagnose conditions such as retinal detachment or optic neuritis.
* A visual field test will assess your peripheral vision and detect any defects or abnormalities in your field of vision.
* ERG or multifocal ERG tests will measure the electrical activity of the retina and can help diagnose conditions such as retinal detachment or optic neuritis.

It's essential to seek medical attention as soon as possible, as some of these conditions can lead to serious complications if left untreated."
I'm about to kill myself because no one knows what's wrong with me.,"This is pretty long but please read it.

I've had pretty bad acne for years and years and because of it I stayed inside a lot. A real lot. I think I stayed inside for about 4 years without going outside at all, even for 5 minutes.

Over that time my acne got worse and worse and I started developing other symptoms such as allergic reactions to foods containing fat. Whenever I'd eat anything with fat in it I'd get a red rash around my nose that would last for 2-3 days.

Eventually it got worse and worse and I realized that I might be deficient in Vitamin D so I took supplements and the rash stopped appearing and my acne got a bit better. I believe this is because vitamin D has an anti-inflammatory effect and stops the immune system from over-reacting.

However, my acne was still a problem and having tried various creams I went to a dermatologist and she gave me some antibiotics to try. 

So I start taking them and I notice strange symptoms like my nose turning red again and my whole face would get really red at night and would feel like it was burning. My nose also started running whenever I ate anything (literally I'd eat a banana and 1 minute later my nose would start running). My right hand also turned red and started swelling up and getting sore, sort of like arthritis.

So I went to the doctor and told her all my symptoms and she ran a test (general test and inflammation test) and she said everything was fine and didn't know what was causing my problems.

After taking the antibiotics for 5 months (which didn't help my acne at all), I stopped taking them. I read online you should take probiotics after you finish a course of antibiotics so I ate a probiotic yogurt every day for 2-3 weeks.

It's now been over a month since I stopped taking the antibiotics. Here's my symptoms now:

- My face is still turning red all the time for no reason. The left side of my face has a permanent red patch.

- My legs have red patches all over them which disappear randomly every 5-6 hours and then come back.

- My right hand still is red compared to my left hand and is stiff/hurts to move my fingers a bit.

- I get small red hives/spots all over my arms/hands whenever I go outside (photo sensitivity probably)

- My skin is peeling off on my right hand (also my nose sometimes as well). Literally my skin is falling off in patches.

- My nose STILL turns red whenever I eat anything with too much fat in it (which I try to avoid). Meat for example will make my nose turn red the next day. Probably the worst symptom. I don't know of anyone who has this.

- I still have acne and my skin is SUPER oily

- I have to pee all the time.

- My tongue is literally yellow. I also get yellow patches of skin all over my face. I think it's some sort of fungal infection but idk what to do about it.

What the hell am I supposed to do? I try to eat healthy, avoid fat, get out in the sun for vitamin D, exercise, drink probiotic yogurt drinks...what else can I do? I feel like staying inside for 4 years has destroyed my immune system and now I'm fucked. I've tried all kinds of supplements...zinc, vitamin A/C/D/E, fish oil and others.

My doctor doesn't have a clue what's wrong with me, my dermatologist is useless and wants to give me more antibiotics for my acne. I asked her about my face/nose turning red and she just shrugged.

Honestly I've been dealing with this crap for years and I can't take it much longer. I have to avoid people because I look like total shit. I can't live a normal life like this. I have no friends at all and I have absolutely nothing left to live for. I feel utterly hopeless.

I doubt anyone has any idea what I should do but I might as well post this as I'm out of options and won't be around much longer if I don't start getting better.

Thanks to anyone who even bothered to read this.",9,"I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. It's understandable that you feel hopeless, but please know that there are people who care and want to help.

Worried about baby's eyes. Pupils are different colors in flash photo.,"I've read that one white pupil can be a sign if various eye conditions, but her eye looks orange. She's 4 months old, no known medical issues. She is going to the doctor this week or next for a checkup. I realizeit canalso be caused by bad lighting and I know that a smartphone isn't the best way to tell.  I am wondering if I should bring this up (well, I probably will, so I guess I'm wondering if her doctor is going to think I'm insane). Thank you for reading. 

http://imgur.com/VRPWqlu. 

",9,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be considered include:

1. **Leukocoria**: A condition where the pupil appears white or cloudy, which can be a sign of several eye disorders, including retinoblastoma, cataracts, or retinal detachment. The orange appearance of the pupil in the image may be a variation of leukocoria.
2. **Coloboma**: A congenital condition where there is a hole or gap in one of the structures of the eye, including the iris, retina, or optic disc.
3. **Anisocoria**: A condition where the pupils are unequal in size, which can be a sign of a neurological or eye disorder.
4. **Congenital cataracts**: A condition where the lens of the eye is cloudy or opaque, which can cause vision problems.

To further evaluate the condition, the doctor may order the following diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Red reflex test**: A simple test where a light is shone through the pupil to check for any abnormalities in the reflection. This test can help identify conditions such as leukocoria or cataracts.
2. **Ophthalmoscopy**: A detailed examination of the eye using an ophthalmoscope to visualize the retina and other structures.
3. **Slit-lamp examination**: A test that uses a specialized microscope to examine the eye in detail, including the iris, lens, and retina.
4. **Ultrasound or CT scan**: Imaging tests that can help identify any structural abnormalities in the eye or brain.
5. **Electroretinography (ERG)**: A test that measures the electrical activity of the retina to assess its function.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* The red reflex test is a simple and non-invasive test that can help identify any abnormalities in the eye.
* Ophthalmoscopy and slit-lamp examination are more detailed tests that can help visualize any structural abnormalities in the eye.
* Ultrasound or CT scan may be ordered if the doctor suspects a structural abnormality in the eye or brain.
* ERG is a test that can help assess the function of the retina and identify any potential problems.

It's completely reasonable to bring this up with the doctor, and they will likely appreciate your concern and diligence in monitoring your child's health. The doctor will likely perform a thorough examination and order any necessary tests to determine the cause of the orange appearance of the pupil."
how important is it to be seen by a doctor? Are my symptoms normal?,"**I understand that any advice given here will be taken at my own risk and nobody will EVER be held responsible for any steps I decide to take! I appreciate any answers though!!!**

I was diagnosed with Chiari Malformation Type 1 several years 

ago. 

Yesterday I was in a car accident. I hit a concrete barrier head on. I was fine to be honest. My neck and shoulder hurt like mad but I figured that was normal after what had happened. Just a little bit ago I started feeling dizzy when turning my head. How important is it to be seen by a doctor? It is super expensive to go to an ER and if I can avoid it, I will. 

I figured it may be normal to have these issues since I already suffer from Chiari Malformation. Can I just sleep it off? Ice packs? Heat? 

Please tell me what you think. I know many will call me stupid for not having gone to the ER yet but please consider that a lot of people in the US just cannot afford it. It can cost thousands even with insurance. This is why I ask. 

Please don't insult me, if possible. I am just asking because I want to avoid paying for medical bills for years. Thank you for any advice you can give me :)



**Info about myself as requested on side panel: White, female, 35, 5 foot 4 inches, 102 lbs**


EDIT: I guess my question is...what can be done for me at an ER and what can happen if I don't go to have it checked out? Just trying to see if it is worth going. If they just tell me to rest then I don't want to pay for an ER visit",9,"I understand your concerns and financial constraints. Given your symptoms and medical history, I'll provide you with possible medical conditions and recommendations for diagnostic tests or evaluations.

**Possible medical conditions:**

1. **Whiplash or neck strain**: The car accident could have caused a whiplash injury, leading to neck and shoulder pain, as well as dizziness when turning your head.
2. **Concussion or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)**: The head-on collision could have caused a concussion, which may be exacerbated by your pre-existing Chiari Malformation.
3. **Cervical spine injury**: The accident could have caused a cervical spine injury, such as a herniated disk or ligament sprain, which may be putting pressure on your spinal cord or nerves.
4. **Chiari Malformation exacerbation**: The accident could have worsened your Chiari Malformation symptoms, leading to increased pressure on your brain and spinal cord.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Seek medical attention**: While I understand your financial concerns, it's essential to get evaluated by a doctor as soon as possible. Delaying medical attention could lead to worsening symptoms or even permanent damage.
2. **ER visit or urgent care**: If you're experiencing dizziness, neck pain, and shoulder pain after a car accident, it's best to get evaluated at an ER or urgent care center. They can assess your condition, provide immediate treatment, and rule out any life-threatening injuries.
3. **Imaging studies**: The doctor may order imaging studies such as:
	* **CT or MRI scans**: To evaluate your cervical spine, brain, and Chiari Malformation.
	* **X-rays**: To check for any fractures or dislocations in your neck or spine.
4. **Neurological evaluation**: A neurological examination can help assess your cognitive function, balance, and coordination, which may be affected by a concussion or worsening Chiari Malformation symptoms.

**What can be done at an ER:**

1. **Initial assessment**: The ER doctor will evaluate your symptoms, medical history, and perform a physical examination.

2. **Permanent damage**: Untreated injuries or conditions, such as a cervical spine injury or concussion, could lead to permanent damage or long-term disability.
3. **Increased risk of complications**: Delaying medical attention could increase the risk of complications, such as spinal cord injury, stroke, or even death.

**Justifications:**

1. **Pre-existing condition**: Your Chiari Malformation increases your risk of complications from a car accident, making it essential to get evaluated by a doctor.
2. **Mechanism of injury**: The head-on collision and concrete barrier impact increase the risk of serious injury, making it crucial to get evaluated at an ER or urgent care center.
3. **Symptom severity**: Your symptoms, such as dizziness and neck pain, suggest a potential underlying injury or condition that requires medical attention.

Please prioritize your health and seek medical attention as soon as possible. If you're concerned about the cost, you can also consider visiting an urgent care center or a community clinic, which may be more affordable than an ER visit."
I'm worried pease HELP!," I am a 38white Female 5 ft tall I weigh 145 pounds  I take lisinipril w/ HCTZ and atenelol for high bp and celexa for depression. 
For about a month my urine has been dark brown. I urinate once a day or once every other day. Never more than 2x in 24hrs. I am now having severe pain in my rt kidney area. (lower back rt side) for the last 2 days I have been running a fever of 101F and the last 24 hrs I have started vomiting. I have been tested for HIV and hepetitis in the last 6 months. My dr can't see me for at least a week. Is this a reason for an ER visit and what could be causing this? 
I have had high bp since I was 17. Only been on meds for about 3 years. Without meds my bp runs about 210/115.  With my meds it runs about 190/95. ",9,"Based on the symptoms you've described, here are possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible medical conditions:

1. **Dehydration**: Dark brown urine and infrequent urination suggest dehydration, which can be exacerbated by vomiting and fever.
2. **Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) or Pyelonephritis**: Severe pain in the right kidney area, fever, and vomiting could indicate a UTI or pyelonephritis, a kidney infection.
3. **Kidney Stones**: Pain in the right kidney area and dark brown urine could be indicative of kidney stones.
4. **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)**: Decreased urine output, dark brown urine, and severe pain in the kidney area may suggest AKI, which can be caused by various factors, including dehydration, medications, or underlying kidney disease.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional, such as a neurologist or primary care physician, to discuss your symptoms and determine the best course of evaluation and treatment."
What's the best way for patients to interact with doctors?,"Hi Doctors! I literally joined to ask this question. I have a specific situation with a friend who is a total hypochondriac. She always thinks something is seriously wrong with her when she is mildly ill. But she insists that she is not a hypochondriac.

Right now she actually has an infection with a rare bacterium (ureaplasma). It started about 7 months ago. She's received several courses of antibiotics and nothing has worked. She says the doctors told her that there was ""no way"" she could have this infection after the first treatment, even when they had positive test results in front of them. She's complained that they've been very condescending to her and insinuating that she's just looking for pills. (Do patients even try to hoard antibiotics? Is that a thing? I thought it was just painkillers.)

I'm worried that she's shooting herself in the foot the way she approaches medical professionals with her attitude that there's always something seriously wrong with her and they're failing to fix it. I'm concerned she might alienate her and that she'll receive worse care. Of course the issue here is that she actually *is* right this time, and this infection is not responding well to treatment.

I've tried gently reminding her that her doctor has many, many years of training and to try and be patient despite her frustration (this infection has been going on for months. but she refuses to believe she could possibly be part of the problem. Any advice?",9,"Based on the symptoms and situation described, possible medical conditions that may be contributing to the friend's persistent infection include:

1. **Antibiotic-resistant Ureaplasma infection**: The fact that the infection has not responded to multiple courses of antibiotics suggests that the bacteria may have developed resistance to the treatments.
2. **Immunocompromised state**: The friend's inability to clear the infection despite repeated treatments may indicate an underlying immunocompromised state, such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes, or another condition that affects the immune system.
3. **Chronic inflammatory disease**: The persistent infection could be contributing to or exacerbating an underlying chronic inflammatory disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus.
4. **Gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract abnormality**: The infection may be related to an underlying abnormality in the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract, such as a fistula or abscess.

Recommended next diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Culture and sensitivity testing**: To confirm the presence of the Ureaplasma infection and determine the antibiotic susceptibility of the bacteria.
2. **Immunological testing**: To assess the friend's immune function and rule out any underlying immunocompromised state.
3. **Inflammatory marker testing**: To evaluate for signs of chronic inflammation and potential underlying inflammatory diseases.
4. **Imaging studies**: Such as ultrasound, CT, or MRI scans to investigate potential gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract abnormalities.
5. **Consultation with an infectious disease specialist**: To provide expert guidance on managing the persistent infection and developing a treatment plan.
6. **Psychological evaluation**: To address the friend's hypochondriac tendencies and develop strategies to improve her communication with healthcare providers and reduce her anxiety and frustration.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* Culture and sensitivity testing is necessary to confirm the presence of the Ureaplasma infection and guide antibiotic treatment.
* Immunological testing and inflammatory marker testing can help identify underlying conditions that may be contributing to the persistent infection.
* Imaging studies can help identify potential anatomical abnormalities that may be contributing to the infection.
* Consultation with an infectious disease specialist can provide expert guidance on managing the infection and developing a treatment plan.
* Psychological evaluation can help address the friend's hypochondriac tendencies and improve her communication with healthcare providers, reducing the risk of alienating her medical team and receiving worse care.

As for the question of whether patients try to hoard antibiotics, yes, it is a concern. Some patients may seek antibiotics inappropriately, which can contribute to antibiotic resistance and other adverse consequences. However, in this case, the friend's persistence in seeking treatment for her infection is likely driven by her hypochondriac tendencies and frustration with her medical team, rather than a desire to hoard antibiotics."
"5-Year Old Girl, Puzzling Symptoms &amp; Blood Tests","Hi there. The patient (daughter of my best friend), has been sick in various ways since the beginning of the year. At first it seemed like an extended cold or flu, which included an ear infection, for which she took antibiotics. There was also a household dosing of Combantrin, because of worms in another family member. There is a slight possibility of swallowing river water. Patient is female, five years old, average height and weight, Caucasian, no medications, no history of medical complaints prior to this year, very healthy diet, usually very active (other than for the past few weeks, due to fatigue). 

Current symptoms as follows:

* Persistent lethargy. Much reduced energy levels.
* Slightly swollen lymph glands. They were very swollen when she had the cold or flu.
* Bloating after eating, especially when food has higher sugar content (porridge with added honey, yogurt).
* Pain in stomach area, especially after eating. 
* Reduced appetite. Not greatly reduced, but definitely some reduction. 
* Intermittent appearance of hives, about once per month. Sometimes they have covered her entire body. Local doctor said likely food reaction, but was not sure. 

Blood tests were done on the basics. Most things came up normal, but several were abnormal, without a clearly related pattern (for us). Abnormal blood results as follows:

* Glucose - Low - 3.1 
* Iron - Low - 4.0
* C-reactive protein - High - 9.5
* TSH - High - 7.3
* Monocytes - High - 1.0

If anything occurs to you I'd appreciate hearing it. Thank you for your time. ",9,"Based on the symptoms and abnormal blood test results, here are some possible medical conditions and recommended next diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible medical conditions:

1. **Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)**: The symptoms of persistent lethargy, bloating, stomach pain, and reduced appetite could be indicative of IBD, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.
2. **Hypothyroidism**: The high TSH level suggests that the patient may have hypothyroidism, which could be contributing to her lethargy, bloating, and reduced appetite.
3. **Iron deficiency anemia**: The low iron level could be causing fatigue, lethargy, and reduced appetite.
4. **Food intolerance or allergy**: The intermittent appearance of hives and bloating after eating certain foods suggests a possible food intolerance or allergy.
5. **Infection or autoimmune disorder**: The high C-reactive protein level and swollen lymph glands could indicate an underlying infection or autoimmune disorder, such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis or lupus.
6. **Gastrointestinal infection or parasitic infection**: The patient's history of swallowing river water and taking Combantrin for worms in another family member raises the possibility of a gastrointestinal infection or parasitic infection, such as giardiasis.
7. **Adrenal insufficiency**: The low glucose level could be indicative of adrenal insufficiency, which could be contributing to her lethargy and reduced appetite.

Recommended next diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Thyroid function tests**: To confirm the diagnosis of hypothyroidism, additional thyroid function tests, such as free T4 and free T3, should be ordered.
2. **Iron studies**: To further evaluate the patient's iron deficiency, iron studies, such as ferritin and transferrin saturation, should be ordered.
3. **Gastrointestinal evaluation**: An upper endoscopy or colonoscopy may be necessary to evaluate the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms and rule out IBD or other gastrointestinal disorders.
4. **Food allergy testing**: To determine if the patient has a food allergy or intolerance, skin prick testing or blood tests, such as IgE or IgG, may be ordered.
5. **Infectious disease testing**: To rule out underlying infections, such as giardiasis or other parasitic infections, stool tests or blood tests, such as Giardia antigen or PCR, may be ordered.
6. **Autoimmune disorder evaluation**: To evaluate the possibility of an autoimmune disorder, such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis or lupus, additional blood tests, such as ANA or rheumatoid factor, may be ordered.
7. **Adrenal function tests**: To evaluate the possibility of adrenal insufficiency, additional blood tests, such as cortisol or ACTH, may be ordered.
8. **Imaging studies**: To evaluate the patient's abdominal symptoms, imaging studies, such as an abdominal ultrasound or CT scan, may be ordered to rule out other underlying conditions, such as appendicitis or intestinal obstruction.
9. **Consultation with a pediatric gastroenterologist or endocrinologist**: Given the complexity of the patient's symptoms and abnormal blood test results, consultation with a pediatric specialist may be necessary to further evaluate and manage the patient's condition.

Justifications for each recommendation:

* The patient's symptoms and abnormal blood test results suggest a complex underlying condition that requires further evaluation and testing.
* The recommended tests and evaluations are necessary to confirm or rule out possible medical conditions and to guide further management and treatment.

Anyways for the problem, I have been experiencing random visual distortion for the past two or three days. These distortions are similar to what you would experience from something like [Neave's ""Strobe.""](http://neave.com/strobe/) I have, for the past month or so, also been experiencing very minor hallucinations, if you can even call them that. I mainly just see bugs that turn out to not be there when I look again, which I've read is fairly common among non-mentally ill people. I also frequently experience auditory hallucinations, which normally sound very real. They're normally just my name being called, but for the past month I have also had short conversations with people that weren't even in the house when I checked (I had been yelling to them from across the house I thought). I do not use drugs (despite my username).

I am not currently taking any medications and I have undiagnosed depression and anxiety issues, but I am going to a psychiatrist soon to deal with those problems. I also experience gender dysphoria which I will be discussing with the psychiatrist soon.

I'm sorry if the quality of my writing is poor, I'm just very scared right now.",9,"I'm here to help you, and I'll do my best to provide a supportive and non-judgmental response.

Based on your symptoms, here are some possible medical conditions that may be contributing to your experiences:

1. **Migraines with aura**: The visual distortions you described, similar to those experienced with Neave's ""Strobe,"" could be indicative of a migraine aura. Migraines can also cause hallucinations, including auditory and visual.
2. **Temporal lobe epilepsy**: The auditory hallucinations, particularly the conversations with people who aren't there, could be a symptom of temporal lobe epilepsy. This condition can cause seizures that affect the temporal lobe, leading to hallucinations and other unusual experiences.
3. **Psychotic disorder**: The combination of visual and auditory hallucinations, as well as the conversations with non-present individuals, could be indicative of a psychotic disorder, such as schizophrenia. However, it's essential to note that psychotic disorders are relatively rare in adolescents, and other factors, like stress, anxiety, and sleep deprivation, can contribute to similar symptoms.
4. **Neurodevelopmental disorders**: Conditions like autism spectrum disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can sometimes present with hallucinations or unusual perceptual experiences.
5. **Sleep disorders**: Sleep deprivation or disorders like narcolepsy can cause hallucinations, particularly auditory ones.
6. **Anxiety and stress-related disorders**: Your undiagnosed depression and anxiety issues, combined with the stress of experiencing gender dysphoria, could be contributing to your symptoms.

To further evaluate your symptoms, a doctor might order the following diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Electroencephalogram (EEG)**: To rule out temporal lobe epilepsy or other seizure disorders.
2. **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Computed Tomography (CT) scan**: To examine the structure of your brain and check for any abnormalities that could be contributing to your symptoms.
3. **Neurological examination**: A thorough examination to assess your neurological function, including vision, hearing, and cognitive abilities.
4. **Psychiatric evaluation**: A comprehensive evaluation by a psychiatrist to assess your mental health, including your depression, anxiety, and gender dysphoria.
5. **Sleep study**: To evaluate your sleep patterns and rule out sleep disorders.
6. **Blood tests**: To check for any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms, such as thyroid disorders or vitamin deficiencies.
7. **Vision and hearing tests**: To rule out any underlying vision or hearing problems that could be contributing to your hallucinations.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* The EEG and MRI/CT scan are essential to rule out any underlying neurological conditions that could be causing your symptoms.
* The neurological examination and psychiatric evaluation will help to assess your overall neurological and mental health, including any potential contributing factors like depression, anxiety, or sleep disorders.
* The sleep study and blood tests will help to identify any underlying sleep or medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms.
* The vision and hearing tests will help to rule out any underlying sensory problems that could be contributing to your hallucinations.

Remember, it's essential to consult with a doctor or a qualified healthcare professional to discuss your symptoms and determine the best course of action. They will be able to evaluate your symptoms, order the necessary tests, and provide a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.

Please take care of yourself and try to stay calm. It's great that you're seeking help and support, and I'm confident that you'll get the help you need to manage your symptoms and improve your overall well-being."
"My partner's 12 year old sister just went into congestive heart failure and I'm worried sick. Not looking to do anything, just want information to calm my nerves.","This is probably not the right subreddit but I'm not sure where else to post.

So my partner's 12 year old sister had been fatigued and nauseated to the point of barely being able to keep anything down for two weeks. When they took her to the doctor they found fluid under her diaphram and in her chest cavity around her heart. The doctor sent her home with strict instructions to go to the hospital if she got worse. Well, she got worse. :\

She woke up the next day, from what I know, visibly weakened and very tired. They took her to the hospital and sometime after arriving she went into congestive heart failure and is now in the ICU.

My partner had to go about 4 hours away and I'm still at uni, just waiting for news. I don't know, do you have any statistics on how likely it is she'll survive or be okay? How common is this? What do they have to do to stabilize her? She is slightly chubby but not obese, about 5 feet tall, not particularly active as far as I know. Any sort of information could help ease my mind, I'm really worried right now and don't know how else to ease my worry.

Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit or breaks any rules or anything.",9,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be considered include:

1. **Pericarditis**: Inflammation of the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart, which can cause fluid accumulation in the chest cavity.
2. **Myocarditis**: Inflammation of the heart muscle, which can lead to congestive heart failure.
3. **Cardiac tamponade**: Fluid accumulation in the pericardial space, which can compress the heart and lead to cardiac failure.
4. **Pulmonary embolism**: A blood clot in the lungs, which can cause fluid accumulation in the chest cavity and lead to cardiac failure.
5. **Infectious diseases**: Such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, or viral infections, which can cause fluid accumulation and cardiac failure.

To further diagnose and manage the condition, the doctor may order the following tests or evaluations:

1. **Echocardiogram**: To evaluate the heart's structure and function, and to assess the amount of fluid in the pericardial space.
2. **Chest X-ray**: To assess the lungs and heart, and to evaluate the amount of fluid in the chest cavity.
3. **Blood tests**: To evaluate liver and kidney function, and to check for signs of infection or inflammation.
4. **Cardiac catheterization**: To evaluate the heart's function and to assess the amount of fluid in the pericardial space.
5. **CT or MRI scan**: To evaluate the heart and lungs, and to assess the amount of fluid in the chest cavity.
6. **Infectious disease testing**: To rule out infectious diseases such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, or viral infections.
7. **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: To evaluate the heart's electrical activity and to assess for signs of cardiac dysfunction.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* The presence of fluid in the chest cavity and around the heart, combined with symptoms of fatigue, nausea, and congestive heart failure, suggests a cardiac or pulmonary condition.
* The echocardiogram and chest X-ray are essential tests to evaluate the heart's structure and function, and to assess the amount of fluid in the pericardial space.
* Blood tests are necessary to evaluate liver and kidney function, and to check for signs of infection or inflammation.
* Cardiac catheterization and CT or MRI scan may be necessary to further evaluate the heart's function and to assess the amount of fluid in the pericardial space.
* Infectious disease testing is necessary to rule out infectious diseases that may be causing the symptoms.
* ECG is necessary to evaluate the heart's electrical activity and to assess for signs of cardiac dysfunction.

As for the likelihood of survival, it's difficult to provide statistics without knowing the underlying cause of the condition. However, with prompt medical attention and treatment, the prognosis for congestive heart failure in children is generally good. The fact that the patient is in the ICU suggests that the condition is being closely monitored and managed, which is a positive sign."
Plantar Fascitis? Help!,"23/f/overweight/pain on left heel for about a month or two, getting worse recently.

I wasn't diagnosed but my symptoms clearly say plantar fascitis. What is the best way to relieve my pain other than rest? I can't seem to rest my feet cause there's always somewhere I gotta go to few times a week.

I've always worn flat shoes and am a little over weight for my height. I am aware I have this weird posture when I'm standing where my left foot is firm against the surface I'm standing on while the other foot isn't (as firm etc etc). I've been trying to consciously shift this habit and put my weight towards the right side instead, or try to distribute my weight on both feet but being very gentle towards my left.

Just recently, I had to sit down for a few minutes after a long walk and when I was ready to go, the pain trying to walk was just so bad that I had to hold on to the nearby chair for support. It wasn't so bad for the past couple of months but this time got me worried so I'm seeking help.

I know the number one suggestion for plantar fascitis is rest, but what if I really had to go to some place and walk a lot every now and then? Will footwear with a little bit of height (heels) make my condition better? Any form of stretching? Exercise?

Thanks in advance! :)",9,"Based on your symptoms, possible medical conditions include:

1. Plantar fasciitis: inflammation of the plantar fascia, a band of tissue that runs along the bottom of the foot.
2. Heel spur: a bony growth on the heel bone that can cause pain and inflammation.
3. Overuse injury: repetitive strain on the foot and ankle from walking or standing.
4. Postural-related strain: abnormal posture and weight distribution can put additional stress on the foot and ankle.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. Physical examination: a doctor will examine your foot and ankle to check for tenderness, swelling, and range of motion.
2. X-rays: to rule out any bony abnormalities, such as heel spurs.
3. Ultrasound or MRI: to evaluate the plantar fascia and surrounding tissues.

To relieve pain without rest, consider the following:

1. **Footwear modification**: Wear shoes with good arch support and a cushioned heel. Avoid flat shoes, and consider shoes with a slight heel (about 1-2 cm) to reduce stress on the plantar fascia. Justification: proper footwear can reduce stress on the plantar fascia and provide cushioning.
2. **Orthotics or shoe inserts**: custom-made or over-the-counter inserts can provide additional arch support and cushioning. Justification: orthotics can help redistribute pressure and reduce stress on the plantar fascia.
3. **Stretching exercises**: gentle stretching of the calf, Achilles tendon, and plantar fascia can help reduce tension and pain. Examples include:
	* Calf stretch: stand facing a wall with one hand on the wall for balance, step one foot back about a foot, and keep your heel on the ground. Bend the front knee and lean forward, stretching the calf muscle. Hold for 15-30 seconds and repeat 2-3 times.
	* Achilles tendon stretch: stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, step forward with one foot, and lower your body down into a lunge position. Keep your back knee almost touching the ground and your front thigh parallel to the ground. Lean forward, stretching the Achilles tendon. Hold for 15-30 seconds and repeat 2-3 times.
	* Plantar fascia stretch: sit on the floor with your affected leg crossed over your other leg. Place your hand on the bottom of your foot and gently pull your toes back, stretching the plantar fascia. Hold for 15-30 seconds and repeat 2-3 times.
	Justification: stretching can help reduce tension and inflammation in the plantar fascia and surrounding tissues.
4. **Night splints**: wearing a night splint can help stretch the plantar fascia and calf muscles while you sleep. Justification: night splints can help reduce morning pain and stiffness.
5. **Physical therapy**: a physical therapist can help you with exercises, stretches, and modalities (such as ultrasound or electrical stimulation) to reduce pain and inflammation. Justification: physical therapy can help address underlying biomechanical issues and promote healing.
6. **Weight management**: losing weight can reduce stress on the foot and ankle. Justification: excess weight can exacerbate plantar fasciitis and other foot and ankle conditions.
7. **Posture correction**: continue to work on correcting your posture and weight distribution to reduce stress on your left foot. Justification: abnormal posture and weight distribution can contribute to plantar fasciitis and other foot and ankle conditions.

Avoid activities that aggravate the condition, such as walking or standing on hard surfaces. When you must walk, try to:

1. Wear comfortable, supportive shoes.
2. Take regular breaks to rest and stretch.
3. Use a walking aid, such as a cane, if necessary.
4. Avoid walking on uneven or hard surfaces.

Remember to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. They can help you develop a personalized plan to manage your symptoms and address any underlying conditions."

For shame.",8,"It appears that the provided text does not describe any medical symptoms. Instead, it seems to be a discussion about verifying the identity of a psychiatrist on a subreddit.

If we were to assume that the text is actually about a patient's symptoms, but the symptoms are not provided, I would recommend the following general diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Complete Medical History**: A thorough review of the patient's medical history to identify any potential underlying conditions.
2. **Physical Examination**: A comprehensive physical examination to look for any signs or symptoms of underlying medical conditions.
3. **Laboratory Tests**: Basic laboratory tests such as complete blood count (CBC), blood chemistry, and urinalysis to rule out any underlying infections or conditions.
4. **Vital Sign Assessment**: Assessment of vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature to identify any potential abnormalities.

However, without any specific symptoms, it is difficult to provide more targeted recommendations. If you could provide the actual symptoms, I would be happy to try and assist you further.

In this case, since there are no symptoms provided, the discussion seems to be about verifying the identity of a psychiatrist, and the recommended next steps would be:

1. **Investigate the Verification Process**: Verify the authenticity of the verification process used to confirm the psychiatrist's identity.
2. **Check Credentials**: Check the psychiatrist's credentials and licensure to ensure they are legitimate and up-to-date.
3. **Report the Incident**: Report the incident to the relevant authorities or the subreddit administrators to prevent any potential harm or misinformation."

I have a question about a very strange symptom that I'm having...,"Hey guys, I'm not sure if this is the place to post but I'm a bit concerned about some weird symptom that I noticed today. I've been sick since Friday (March 28), with what I believe to be a viral infection/flu. I've had stuffy nose, congestion, chills, headaches, fever (around 102 at one point), very sore throat, and swollen glands in my neck. I already went to the doctor yesterday and he said it's not strep, and he's pretty sure it's a viral infection. However, today I noticed a very weird symptom that I've never had before that's concerning me. I noticed that I have little spots on my fingertip of my right hand's middle finger, and the same type of spot appears on my left hand's pointer, but much smaller. I tried everything to get it off from regular washing/scrubbing to rubbing alcohol, but nothing works. It seems that the spots may be under my skin. I read on some online forums and one suggested that it may have to do with low platelet count and the capillaries bursting, but I'm not so sure. It's a bit worrying, so if there's anything you guys can tell me or point me in the right direction then that would be greatly appreciated. Also, the only symptoms from the viral infection that I believe I had that are still present are the very sore, red throat (it hurts to swallow) and the congestion, with coughing and a stuffy nose. I've always been pretty tired but that seems like it would be a regular thing that comes with being sick.

I'll try my hardest to get pictures on here ASAP! Thanks a ton!

EDIT 2 FOR INFO: I noticed you guys like info on this sub, so here are my specs:

17 y/o Male, 6'3"", 150 lb., white. I've been taking advil (ibuprofen), tylenol, throat drops, and nose spray, but never the tylenol or advil at once.",8,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be considered include:

1. **Viral exanthem**: A rash caused by a viral infection, which could be related to the underlying viral illness.
2. **Petechiae**: Small spots on the skin caused by bleeding from capillaries, which could be related to a low platelet count or other blood disorders.
3. **Vasculitis**: Inflammation of blood vessels, which could cause skin lesions and other symptoms.
4. **Infectious mononucleosis**: A viral infection that can cause a sore throat, fever, and swollen glands, as well as a rash or skin lesions.
5. **Thrombocytopenia**: A low platelet count, which could cause bleeding or bruising, including petechiae.

To further evaluate these symptoms, the doctor may order the following diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: To check for a low platelet count or other blood disorders that could be causing the skin lesions.
2. **Blood smear**: To examine the blood cells and platelets for any abnormalities.
3. **Mononucleosis spot test**: To check for infectious mononucleosis.
4. **Viral panel**: To check for other viral infections that could be causing the symptoms.
5. **Skin biopsy**: To examine the skin lesions and determine their cause.
6. **Coagulation studies**: To check for any bleeding disorders that could be causing the petechiae.
7. **Imaging studies**: Such as a chest X-ray or CT scan, to check for any other underlying conditions that could be causing the symptoms.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* The CBC and blood smear are recommended to check for a low platelet count or other blood disorders that could be causing the skin lesions.
* The mononucleosis spot test and viral panel are recommended to check for infectious mononucleosis or other viral infections that could be causing the symptoms.
* The skin biopsy is recommended to examine the skin lesions and determine their cause.
* The coagulation studies are recommended to check for any bleeding disorders that could be causing the petechiae.
* The imaging studies are recommended to check for any other underlying conditions that could be causing the symptoms, such as pneumonia or other infections.

It's also important to note that the patient's age, height, and weight are within normal limits, and the use of ibuprofen, tylenol, throat drops, and nose spray are common over-the-counter medications that are unlikely to cause the skin lesions. However, the doctor may still want to ask about any other medications or supplements the patient is taking, as well as any other medical conditions or allergies."
"MIL collapsed, diagnosis help?","Location: China.  MIL (55 yo, no health issues that I know of) scheduled appointment in hospital to remove cyst on sole of foot.  Surgery went well, and stayed in hospital to recover.  This afternoon (still in hospital), she ate a mango and shortly after felt faint, headache, then passed out with hands shaking.  Couple hours later she's hooked up to a respirator, BP is very low, lungs have bloody mucus.  Neuro suspects some brain issue (she has ""small brain vessels""?) but unable to take CT because she's all hooked up to the respirator.  

I don't have much more information as I'm at home watching the kid, but could probably get some messages over.

Any ideas?  Not sure if mango was the cause of it as she's eaten them before with no issue.  Doctors here don't seem to have a clue and wife is freaking the fuck out.  Help!",8,"Given the symptoms and situation, here are possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible medical conditions:

1. **Anaphylaxis**: A severe, life-threatening allergic reaction that could be triggered by the mango, despite previous consumption without issues. The symptoms of fainting, headache, shaking hands, low blood pressure, and respiratory distress support this possibility.
2. **Cerebral vasculitis**: Inflammation of the blood vessels in the brain, which could be related to the ""small brain vessels"" mentioned by the neurologist. This condition could cause headache, fainting, and neurological symptoms.
3. **Infectious or inflammatory response**: A possible infection or inflammatory response related to the surgery, hospital stay, or other factors, which could cause fever, headache, and respiratory symptoms.
4. **Toxic or metabolic disorder**: A potential toxic or metabolic disorder, such as a reaction to anesthesia or other medications, which could cause a range of symptoms, including neurological and respiratory issues.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Blood tests**: Complete blood count (CBC), blood chemistry, and inflammatory marker tests (e.g., C-reactive protein) to rule out infection, inflammation, or other systemic conditions.
2. **Allergy testing**: Specific tests, such as skin prick testing or blood tests (e.g., IgE), to determine if an allergic reaction to mango or other substances is the cause.
3. **Imaging studies**: Once the patient is stable and can be safely transported, a CT or MRI scan of the brain to evaluate the ""small brain vessels"" and rule out other neurological conditions, such as stroke or cerebral edema.
4. **Respiratory tests**: Bronchoscopy or tracheal aspirate to investigate the cause of bloody mucus and respiratory distress.
5. **Toxicology screening**: Tests to detect potential toxins or substances that could be contributing to the patient's condition.
6. **Cardiology evaluation**: Assessment of cardiac function, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram, to rule out cardiac causes of low blood pressure and respiratory distress.
7. **Neurological evaluation**: A thorough neurological examination, including assessment of mental status, cognitive function, and motor function, to determine the extent of any neurological involvement.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* The combination of symptoms, including fainting, headache, shaking hands, low blood pressure, and respiratory distress, suggests a severe, potentially life-threatening condition that requires prompt investigation.
* The mention of ""small brain vessels"" by the neurologist warrants further evaluation of the brain and its blood vessels.
* The patient's recent surgery and hospital stay increase the risk of infection, inflammation, or other hospital-acquired conditions.
* The consumption of mango before the onset of symptoms raises the possibility of an allergic reaction or other substance-related cause.

It is essential to communicate with the medical team and provide them with as much information as possible to help guide their diagnostic efforts."
"14 Years old, Mom punishing me for my weight, is my weight seriously unhealthy?","Honestly right now, I think my weight is great. I have athletic ability and run/play tennis regularly since I was on my varsity tennis team, and I eat whenever I'm hungry, however I'm not hungry very often. I lost a ton of weight over the past two years, going from 190 to 113 (current weight). My mom however keeps telling me that I'm way too underweight and going to land myself in the hospital, but I'm super reluctant because she used to always feed me fast foods and fried food when I was a kid and didn't know better, landing me all the way up to nearly 200 pounds when I was 12.  I'm extremely happy with my weight right now and would be sad to gain ~10 pounds as she is telling me to. I checked my BMI with a calculator and it lands me in the healthy range.  So, is my weight really unhealthy?

Age : 14

Sex : Male

Height : 5'5""

Race: Chinese

Location : California

No medical issues.",8,"Based on the symptoms and information provided, possible medical conditions that may be considered include:

1. **Anorexia Nervosa or other Eating Disorders**: The significant weight loss over the past two years, lack of hunger, and reluctance to gain weight despite being underweight may indicate an eating disorder.
2. **Malnutrition**: Inadequate nutrition and infrequent hunger may lead to malnutrition, which can cause a range of health problems.
3. **Growth and Development Issues**: As a 14-year-old male, it is essential to ensure that weight loss is not affecting growth and development, particularly during puberty.
4. **Body Image Distortion**: The individual's perception of their weight and body image may be distorted, which can be a sign of an underlying psychological issue.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Physical Examination**: A thorough physical examination by a pediatrician or a healthcare professional to assess overall health, including vital signs, and to look for any signs of malnutrition or other health issues.
2. **Laboratory Tests**: Blood tests to check for any nutritional deficiencies, such as vitamin and mineral levels, and to assess overall health.
3. **BMI Measurement**: Although the individual has already checked their BMI, a healthcare professional should measure and assess BMI to confirm whether it is within a healthy range for their age and height.
4. **Psychological Evaluation**: A consultation with a psychologist or a therapist to assess body image perception, eating habits, and overall mental health.
5. **Growth Chart Analysis**: A review of the individual's growth chart to ensure that weight loss is not affecting growth and development.
6. **Dietary Assessment**: A dietary assessment to evaluate eating habits, including frequency and quality of meals, to identify any potential nutritional deficiencies.
7. **Family Therapy**: A family therapy session to address concerns and misconceptions about weight and eating habits, and to ensure that the individual is receiving a balanced and nutritious diet.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* A physical examination and laboratory tests are necessary to assess overall health and identify any potential health issues.
* A psychological evaluation is essential to address body image distortion and potential eating disorders.
* A growth chart analysis and dietary assessment are necessary to ensure that weight loss is not affecting growth and development, and to identify any potential nutritional deficiencies.
* Family therapy is recommended to address concerns and misconceptions about weight and eating habits, and to ensure that the individual is receiving a balanced and nutritious diet.

It is essential to note that a BMI calculator may not always provide an accurate assessment of health, particularly for athletes or individuals with a muscular build. A healthcare professional should assess BMI in the context of overall health and other factors."
Is it likely I have a neurodegenerative disorder?,"I apologize for my last poorly crafted post here. Let me try this again so you lot have more information. I have developed a plethora of symptoms and I think might potentially be the result of neural problems. I know this stuff is the realm of a neurologist (am seeing one soon) but in the interest of second opinions I considered someone around here might have other ideas. 

I'm a 26 years old male, 5' 9"", and 163 lbs. No medications currently (except for Ativan since I had a panic attack last night.. trying to not take it). I'm causaian, have no history of neuro disorders in my family. I had struggled with social anxieties most of my life, but very little depression except for at times. I have used cannabis, heavy user and times but often just moderately and rather variable in frequency. Slowly my symptoms have been developing for the last 4-6 months. The neurological problems started some 2-4 weeks ago. 


* Started with odd stretchy and stabby pains in my body, sometimes a dull pain in my calfs. The feeling like certain parts of my body weren't healing from exercise easily.
* What felt like nerve pain in my arms, mostly in the elbow (often the pit) and some dull pain in my tendon that was exacerbated by computer use
* More recently, as of 2-3 weeks ago or a little longer, I noticed that parts of my vision and body were tremoring slightly
* Now, a lot of my movement is starting to feel jerky and involuntary
* I am having trouble balancing and I feel wobbly in my posture
* There's a pressure in my head on the right side, just a rather odd light pressure that never goes away. My right eye vision is much more blurry that normal.
* Both ears feel like there's a pressure to them slightly, and when I yawn sometimes I feel a slight relief. The doc last night at the hospital (had a panic attack..) noticed my right ear was competely clogged
* For the past 2-3 weeks my appetite is practically non-existent. I've been forcing myself to eat food and pretty much nothing tastes good.
* My tongue moves erratically a bit when I stick it out
* My mind feels a bit foggy, like a slight cognitive deficit.. sometimes hard to recall things but I don't feel terribly dumb yet either. 
* I have a weird sensation like I can feel my blood pumping a lot. Especially on the left side of my head, above the ear. It pulsates, like some kind of pumping. I had noticed this pumping feeling in many other places in my body too. Like my veins/arteries are ""pumping hard"", but doctor's lab work comes back like everything's normal.. BP too.
* I find myself losing track of what i'm doing and a little more forgetful
* My blood pressure is normal when checked, so is BG, and the typical labwork done at the hospital when I went appeared absolutely perfect. Everything within normal range.
* Antinuclear antibodies are normal, sedimentary rate is normal range, and creatine kinase is also normal (had these checked some month or so ago before my neurological symptoms appeared).
* My CT scan yesterday looked fine, but when my doctor's office called back they said there was potential ""cortical shrinkage"". When I had a panic attack last night, the staff at the hospital were a bit pissed they told me this. I think they were angry because it scared me and I thought myself into a panic attack last night. At the hospital I probably horrified everyone in the waiting room.. Feel okay now though and I have Ativan in a bottle for when I need it.
* I was given a Lyme test, but it was just the ELISA and not a western blot test to go with it.. This is obviously not very reliable, but based on my symptoms it doesn't strike me as likely to be lyme.


Based on all of what's going on.. I kind of feel like the ""cortical shrinkage"" is probably ""cortical atrophy"" and I pretty much have a neurodegenerative problem. I'm trying to cope but it's a struggle waiting for my neurologist appointment, and I couldn't convince anyone to schedule a MRI until then. 

I would greatly appreciate any second opinions. Thank you for your time here!",8,"Based on the symptoms described, here are some possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible Medical Conditions:

1. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**: The symptoms of nerve pain, vision problems, tremors, and balance issues are consistent with MS. The ""cortical shrinkage"" mentioned in the CT scan report could be indicative of demyelination, a hallmark of MS.
2. **Neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Frontotemporal dementia)**: The cognitive deficits, memory problems, and ""cortical shrinkage"" could be indicative of a neurodegenerative disorder. However, the age of the patient and the relatively rapid progression of symptoms make this less likely.
3. **Vasculitis or autoimmune disorders (e.g., Lupus, Rheumatoid Arthritis)**: The symptoms of nerve pain, vision problems, and ""pumping"" sensation in the head and body could be indicative of an autoimmune disorder.
4. **Infectious diseases (e.g., Lyme disease, Neurosyphilis)**: Although the ELISA test for Lyme disease was negative, it is essential to consider other infectious diseases that could cause similar symptoms.
5. **Mitochondrial disorders**: The symptoms of muscle pain, fatigue, and ""pumping"" sensation in the head and body could be indicative of a mitochondrial disorder.

Recommended Diagnostic Tests or Evaluations:

1. **MRI of the brain and spine**: To confirm the presence of ""cortical atrophy"" and to rule out other conditions such as MS, vasculitis, or infectious diseases.
2. **Electromyography (EMG) and Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS)**: To evaluate the nerve function and rule out conditions such as peripheral neuropathy.
3. **Lumbar puncture (LP)**: To collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for analysis and to rule out conditions such as MS, infectious diseases, or autoimmune disorders.
4. **Blood tests**: To rule out conditions such as vasculitis, autoimmune disorders, or infectious diseases. Tests may include:
	* Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
	* C-reactive protein (CRP)
	* Antinuclear antibodies (ANA)
	* Rheumatoid factor (RF)
	* Lyme disease Western blot test
5. **Neuropsychological evaluation**: To assess cognitive function and rule out conditions such as neurodegenerative disorders or mitochondrial disorders.
6. **Ophthalmological evaluation**: To assess vision problems and rule out conditions such as optic neuritis or other eye disorders.
7. **Audiological evaluation**: To assess hearing problems and rule out conditions such as otosclerosis or other ear disorders.
8. **Mitochondrial function tests**: To evaluate mitochondrial function and rule out conditions such as mitochondrial disorders.

Justifications for each recommendation:

* MRI and LP are essential to confirm the presence of ""cortical atrophy"" and to rule out other conditions that could cause similar symptoms.
* EMG and NCS are necessary to evaluate nerve function and rule out conditions such as peripheral neuropathy.
* Blood tests are essential to rule out conditions such as vasculitis, autoimmune disorders, or infectious diseases.
* Neuropsychological evaluation is necessary to assess cognitive function and rule out conditions such as neurodegenerative disorders or mitochondrial disorders.
* Ophthalmological and audiological evaluations are necessary to assess vision and hearing problems and rule out conditions such as optic neuritis or otosclerosis.
* Mitochondrial function tests are necessary to evaluate mitochondrial function and rule out conditions such as mitochondrial disorders.

It is essential to note that these recommendations are based on the symptoms described and may not be exhaustive. A comprehensive evaluation by a neurologist and other specialists is necessary to determine the underlying cause of the symptoms."
Unending MDMA highs - three months and counting.,"Long one here, but I hope it might be interesting:

24, Male, 6'2'', 64 kgs, White.

On the tenth of March this year I began to experience intermittent MDMA highs, despite having not taken the drug for a month. The highs would come approximately once a day, mostly in the evening, and would be gone by the morning. All physiological symptoms of the high occur including dilated pupils, dry mouth, as well as the usual sensations of physical pleasure and mental speed-up. When the highs wore off I would be left with intense anxiety and, sometimes, panic attacks.

I saw a doctor who prescribed Diazepam which helped with the anxiety but did nothing to stop the highs. I continued for two months, my general ability to think and perceive decreasing with every episode, the lows getting lower until I could barely read or follow a conversation. Recently, however, the lows do not occur. I have been high for ten days and my mind and body are giving up - I am experiencing constant vertigo and I feel almost claustrophobic as I am always disorientated and disconnected. My short-term memory is terrible, and I often forget what I am doing, what I have just said in a conversation and how I come to hold objects or where objects go to be put away.

I subsequently saw an endocrinologist, who took many blood tests that returned normale, and then a psychiatrist. The psych prescribed Valporate/Depakote first, but as I took the medication the highs became more frequent and intense over the course of a week. Valporate was discontinued, then I was given Quetiapine/Seroquel. A single 25mg dose of Quetiapine induced an extremely intense MDMA high 30 minutes after taking it, and the psychiatrist decided to discontinue the treatment immediately. The psych has now referred me for an MRI scan and to speak to a neurologist.

I doubt anyone here is specialist enough to give any ideas, but I'm looking to spread my story around in the rare chance of catching someone's eye who may have an idea/interest in this case. I'm open to any wild theories, too, as several doctors have conceded that neither they nor their peers have every heard of such a case. There is a time consideration on the issue, too, as in the past ten days my abilities have degraded so considerably that I feel in another ten days I will be unable to communicate properly.

As a note, I have no history of psychological disorders and my psych evaluation was determined to be normal, aside from the anxiety.
",8,"Given the unique and complex symptoms presented, here are possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

**Possible Medical Conditions:**

1. **Serotonin Syndrome**: The symptoms of intermittent MDMA highs, anxiety, and panic attacks could be related to an imbalance of serotonin levels in the brain.
2. **Temporal Lobe Epilepsy**: The episodes of altered consciousness, disorientation, and memory loss may be indicative of a seizure disorder affecting the temporal lobe.
3. **Neuroendocrine Disorder**: The endocrinologist's normal blood test results do not entirely rule out a neuroendocrine disorder, such as a pituitary or adrenal gland issue, which could be causing the symptoms.
4. **Autoimmune Encephalitis**: This condition, characterized by an immune system attack on the brain, could lead to the symptoms of altered consciousness, memory loss, and disorientation.
5. **Toxicity or Poisoning**: The possibility of exposure to a substance that could be causing the symptoms, such as a toxic chemical or a contaminated substance, should be considered.

**Recommended Diagnostic Tests or Evaluations:**

1. **MRI Scan with Contrast**: The already scheduled MRI scan should include contrast to help identify any potential lesions, tumors, or abnormalities in the brain.
2. **EEG (Electroencephalogram)**: To evaluate for seizure activity or abnormal brain wave patterns, which could be indicative of temporal lobe epilepsy or another seizure disorder.
3. **Lumbar Puncture (Spinal Tap)**: To collect cerebrospinal fluid for analysis, which could help diagnose conditions such as autoimmune encephalitis or multiple sclerosis.
4. **Toxicology Screen**: To rule out exposure to substances that could be causing the symptoms, such as toxic chemicals or contaminated substances.
5. **Neuropsychological Evaluation**: A comprehensive evaluation of cognitive function, including memory, attention, and executive function, to assess the extent of cognitive decline.
6. **Hormone Level Tests**: Repeat hormone level tests, including cortisol, thyroid, and growth hormone, to rule out any underlying neuroendocrine disorders.
7. **Sleep Study**: To evaluate for sleep disorders, such as narcolepsy or sleep apnea, which could be contributing to the symptoms.
8. **Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) Testing**: To assess the function of the ANS, which could be affected in conditions such as serotonin syndrome or autoimmune encephalitis.

**Justifications:**

* The MRI scan and EEG are essential for evaluating the brain's structure and function, which could help identify potential causes of the symptoms.
* The lumbar puncture and toxicology screen are necessary to rule out conditions such as autoimmune encephalitis or toxicity.
* The neuropsychological evaluation and hormone level tests will help assess the extent of cognitive decline and rule out underlying neuroendocrine disorders.
* The sleep study and ANS testing will help evaluate the potential contribution of sleep disorders or autonomic nervous system dysfunction to the symptoms.

**Next Steps:**

* The patient should undergo the recommended diagnostic tests and evaluations as soon as possible, given the rapid progression of symptoms.
* The patient should be closely monitored by a neurologist and psychiatrist to adjust treatment plans accordingly.
* The patient's medication regimen should be carefully managed to avoid exacerbating the symptoms, as seen with the Valporate and Quetiapine trials."
"For the second time now, I have extracted a white, circular thing I found underneath my foreskin...","**NSFW**: http://imgur.com/a/kHgcl

Following a stinging pain I removed this white thing from underneath my foreskin. This is the second time I've found something like this in the past 6 months or so, both time accompanied with stinging pain underneath head of penis. The first time the white thing was noticeably harder. You can see in the last photo of the album the slit from which it was removed. Both times it was lodged quite deep and took a bit of effort to maneuver it out. ",8,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be considered include:

1. **Smegma accumulation**: Smegma is a natural substance that can accumulate under the foreskin, and if not properly cleaned, can cause irritation and pain. The white substance removed could be a buildup of smegma.
2. **Penile pearls or Fordyce spots**: These are small, white or yellowish bumps that can appear on the penis, often under the foreskin. They are usually harmless but can cause discomfort if they become irritated or infected.
3. **Urethral or penile cysts**: A cyst is a closed sac that can form under the skin, and in this case, under the foreskin. It can cause pain and discomfort, especially if it becomes infected.
4. **Balanitis**: This is an inflammation of the glans penis, which can cause pain, redness, and swelling. The stinging pain and white substance removed could be related to balanitis.
5. **Penile dermatitis**: This is a skin condition that can cause inflammation, itching, and pain on the penis. The white substance removed could be a result of the skin condition.

To further diagnose the condition, a doctor might order the following tests or evaluations:

1. **Physical examination**: A thorough examination of the penis, including the foreskin and glans, to check for any signs of infection, inflammation, or other abnormalities.
2. **Urine analysis**: To check for any signs of urinary tract infection (UTI) or other conditions that could be contributing to the symptoms.
3. **Swab test**: A swab test may be taken from the area under the foreskin to check for any bacterial or fungal infections.
4. **Ultrasound or imaging tests**: To rule out any underlying conditions such as cysts or tumors that could be causing the symptoms.
5. **Biopsy**: If the doctor suspects a skin condition or other abnormality, a biopsy may be taken to examine the tissue under a microscope.
6. **Sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing**: To rule out any STIs that could be contributing to the symptoms.

Justifications for these recommendations include:

* The need to rule out underlying infections or conditions that could be contributing to the symptoms.
* The importance of examining the penis and foreskin to check for any signs of inflammation, infection, or other abnormalities.
* The possibility that the white substance removed could be a sign of an underlying condition that needs to be further investigated.
* The need to consider the patient's medical history and other factors that could be contributing to the symptoms."
Everything I eat keeps going into my nasal passages... WHAT THE HECK!!!,"Ugh every single thing I eat, I can feel it going into my nasal passages. My nose keeps burning (on the side under my eyes)... this is so uncomfortable. Why is it doing this...??!!
(F/21, 5'6'' 180 lbs, asian &amp; white, live in SoCAL)
This has been happening since I had sinusitis in April. 
Whenever I swallow, I feel liquids going into my nose and I have to quickly inhale in my nose and try to swallow again. And I can feel little bits of food traveling there (like little pieces of rice or chewed up other pieces of food.)
Currently it happened while I was chewing my vitamins and now my nasal passage is burning and I'm getting a sinus headache.
Am I gonna get sinusitis again? That was so annoying...

Also I have a cough that never goes away.",8,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be contributing to these issues include:

1. **Nasal septal perforation**: A hole in the thin wall of cartilage and bone (nasal septum) that separates the two sides of the nasal passages. This could be causing food and liquids to enter the nasal passages.
2. **Sinusitis**: As the patient has a history of sinusitis, it's possible that the condition has recurred or that there is ongoing inflammation and infection in the sinuses.
3. **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**: Stomach acid flowing up into the throat and nasal passages could be causing the burning sensation and discomfort.
4. **Eustachian tube dysfunction**: The Eustachian tube connects the middle ear to the back of the throat and helps regulate air pressure. Dysfunction of this tube could be causing the sensation of food and liquids entering the nasal passages.
5. **Allergies or environmental irritants**: Exposure to allergens or irritants could be causing inflammation and discomfort in the nasal passages.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Nasal endoscopy**: A flexible tube with a camera and light on the end is inserted into the nasal passages to visualize the nasal septum, turbinates, and sinuses. This can help identify any abnormalities, such as a nasal septal perforation or sinusitis.
2. **CT scan of the sinuses**: A computed tomography (CT) scan can provide detailed images of the sinuses and help identify any inflammation, infection, or structural abnormalities.
3. **Acid reflux testing**: A test such as an ambulatory acid probe study or an upper endoscopy can help diagnose GERD and determine if stomach acid is flowing up into the throat and nasal passages.
4. **Hearing test and tympanometry**: These tests can help evaluate Eustachian tube function and middle ear pressure.
5. **Allergy testing**: Skin prick testing or blood tests can help identify any allergies that may be contributing to the symptoms.
6. **Laryngoscopy**: A flexible tube with a camera and light on the end is inserted into the throat to visualize the vocal cords and surrounding tissues. This can help identify any abnormalities, such as acid reflux damage or inflammation.
7. **Chest X-ray and pulmonary function tests**: These tests can help evaluate the patient's cough and determine if there are any underlying respiratory conditions, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Justifications for these recommendations:

* The patient's symptoms of food and liquids entering the nasal passages, burning sensation, and sinus headache suggest a possible issue with the nasal septum, sinuses, or Eustachian tube.
* The history of sinusitis and ongoing cough suggest that there may be an underlying respiratory condition that needs to be evaluated and treated.
* The patient's symptoms of acid reflux, such as burning sensation and discomfort, suggest that GERD may be a contributing factor.
* Allergy testing and environmental evaluations can help identify any allergens or irritants that may be contributing to the symptoms."
Is breastfeeding my husband healthy? (x-post /r/askadoctor),"recently weaned my child.

However, the pressure in my breasts hurt. And, frankly, I felt terrible just pumping and wasting the milk. I know my husband had always been interested in my breast milk. I figured it wouldn't hurt to let him suck some out and satisfy his curiousity and kill 2 birds. It felt great for me and my husband was happy and enjoyed it, too. Apparently, he liked the taste. Within the day, he asked to try again. I obliged. I realized I was just emptying my breasts which would mean more milk production. But it was very relieving and I felt like the milk was being put to better use than throwing it out.

The only thing was that this continued the next day, and the next and so on. I stay at home and my husband also works from home. It was extremely easy just to ask hubby to help drain my breasts. He was happy to bury his face in my breasts and drink the milk; he enjoyed the taste of it. It also felt great for me because it felt like I was giving him something really nutritious to eat; that I was providing for him (just like he provides for me-it's a partnership).

Now this has been going on a few months. He drinks from me multiple times a day. I'm sure I'm producing much over a litre a day, maybe upwards of 2. He drinks all he can and I'm happy to oblige. It makes up a significant part of his diet. He says he feels completely healthy and has no complaints.

My question is, is this unhealthy for either of us? Should we reduce or stop this? I can't find any concrete health reasons, but I know this isn't 'natural' or normal. So, I'd love insight.

(For the record, we are healthy, disease-free in our early thrities)
",8,"Based on the symptoms and situation described, possible medical conditions to consider are:

1. **Hyperlactation**: The woman is producing an excessive amount of milk, potentially leading to discomfort, breast engorgement, or other complications.
2. **Induced Lactation**: The woman's body has adapted to produce milk in response to the frequent stimulation, which may lead to hormonal imbalances or other issues.
3. **Nutritional Deficiencies**: The husband's reliance on breast milk as a significant part of his diet may lead to nutritional deficiencies, as breast milk is not designed to meet the nutritional needs of adults.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Blood Tests**: To check for hormonal imbalances, particularly prolactin levels, which may be elevated due to frequent breast stimulation.
2. **Breast Examination**: To assess breast health, check for any signs of infection, and evaluate the effectiveness of the current milk expression method.
3. **Nutritional Assessment**: To evaluate the husband's diet and identify potential nutritional deficiencies, such as protein, vitamin, or mineral deficiencies.
4. **Lactation Consultation**: To assess the woman's lactation and provide guidance on managing milk production, addressing any concerns or complications, and discussing the potential risks and benefits of induced lactation.
5. **Psychological Evaluation**: To explore the emotional and psychological aspects of this arrangement, ensuring that both partners are comfortable and consenting to the situation.
6. **Discussion with a Healthcare Provider**: To review the situation, discuss potential risks and benefits, and determine the best course of action for both partners.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* Blood tests and breast examinations can help identify any underlying hormonal or breast-related issues.
* Nutritional assessments can ensure the husband is receiving a balanced diet and identify potential deficiencies.
* Lactation consultations can provide guidance on managing milk production and addressing any lactation-related concerns.
* Psychological evaluations can help ensure that both partners are comfortable and consenting to the situation, and that there are no underlying emotional or psychological issues.
* A discussion with a healthcare provider can help review the situation, discuss potential risks and benefits, and determine the best course of action for both partners.

It is essential to note that while there may not be concrete health reasons to stop this practice, it is crucial to monitor and address any potential issues that may arise. A healthcare provider can help the couple weigh the benefits and risks and make informed decisions about their situation."
Should i get checked for wilsons disease?,"Hey guys I've been having some minor symptoms that have lately been getting worse. I am going to go to the doctors anyway but i was wondering if i should push to be tested for wilsons disease. 
My symptoms are;

fatigue, nausea, getting confused while reading (i like watching kung fu movies with subtitles and ive noticed lately they change before i can finish the short sentence) , having difficulty talking (jumble up words a lot), joint pain, random short bouts of abdominal pain.

another thing is i have this ring on my iris around my pupil but i'm not sure if it could be classified as a Kayser-Fleischer rings so i took a picture.

http://imgur.com/tNp4idm

people i've asked deny seeing any sort of ring around my eye but i swear i see something... Thanks for any replies, and maybe some other suggestions on what i should look out for before i go.",8,"Based on the symptoms you've described, here are some possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Wilson's Disease**: Given your symptoms, particularly the ring around your iris (potential Kayser-Fleischer ring), fatigue, and neurological symptoms (confusion, difficulty talking), Wilson's disease is a plausible consideration. A doctor may order:
	* 24-hour urine test for copper excretion
	* Serum ceruloplasmin level test
	* Liver function tests (e.g., ALT, AST)
	* Genetic testing for ATP7B gene mutations (if other tests are inconclusive)
2. **Neurological Disorders**: Your symptoms of confusion, difficulty talking, and joint pain could be related to various neurological conditions, such as:
	* Multiple Sclerosis: MRI of the brain and spine, evoked potentials (e.g., VEP, SEP)
	* Parkinson's Disease: Dopamine transporter scan (DaTSCAN), neurological examination
	* Neuropathy: Electromyography (EMG), nerve conduction studies (NCS)
3. **Gastrointestinal Issues**: Abdominal pain and nausea could be related to:
	* Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD): Colonoscopy, upper endoscopy, stool tests (e.g., calprotectin)
	* Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS): Rome IV criteria evaluation, stool tests (e.g., lactoferrin)
	* Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): Upper endoscopy, ambulatory acid probe test
4. **Ophthalmological Conditions**: The ring around your iris could be related to:
	* Kayser-Fleischer ring (as you mentioned): Slit-lamp examination by an ophthalmologist
	* Arcus senilis: Lipid profile, cardiovascular risk assessment
5. **Other Conditions**: Fatigue, joint pain, and nausea could be related to:
	* Anemia: Complete Blood Count (CBC), iron studies
	* Hypothyroidism: Thyroid function tests (e.g., TSH, free T4)
	* Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including sleep studies and psychological assessment

Before your doctor's visit, consider:

* Keeping a symptom journal to track the frequency, severity, and duration of your symptoms
* Gathering information about your family medical history, particularly regarding neurological or gastrointestinal conditions
* Preparing a list of questions to ask your doctor, such as:
	+ What are the possible causes of my symptoms?
	+ What tests or evaluations do you recommend?
	+ How will we determine the best course of treatment?
	+ Are there any lifestyle changes or modifications I can make to alleviate my symptoms?"
Rectal discharge help,"I'm a 26yo straight Asian male, 5'11"", 176lbs (down from 202lbs before the problem started). I've been experiencing continuous rectal discharge since the last week of May. I barely see anything when I wipe- i.e., it's a clear liquid (no feces) and it's not plenty enough to stain clothes- but it comes out continuously throughout the day. I had a colonoscopy to figure out what's wrong and they found I had non-specific colitis, a hyperplastic polyp (that was removed), and hemorrhoids, but none of which were determined to be the cause of the continuous discharge. My colorectal surgeon referred me to a gastroenterologist who gave me probiotics for two weeks (S. Boulardii) but that only cleared up my severe cystic acne and did nothing for the discharge. He then prescribed me Pentasa suppositories, but I reacted adversely on the 7th suppository (weak, body hurt, chills, hot eyes, slight fever, vomiting) so I stopped taking that. He reassessed my case by watching the colonoscopy video himself and determined that the inflammation along the colon was quite mild; the most noticeable area of inflammation was at the terminal ileum, although this did not seem bad enough to warrant further use of anti-inflammatories or an endoscopy to probe the small intestine.

Since the discharge started, I've had a bitter taste in my mouth whenever I have a hard time digesting food (e.g., tough meat). I also had an episode of severe diarrhea (~15 explosive, liquid bowel movements in 16hrs) that led to an increase in the rectal discharge, a new cystic acne breakout, and abdominal pain, particularly when eating fiber (bloating). I have drastically reduced my fiber and carbohydrate intake since then.

Aside from the colonoscopy, I also had a routine stool test and stool culture/sensitivity done, as well as blood work to test for the following: creatinine, SGPT, SGOT, ALP, total protein/albumin/globulin, bilirubin, FBS, ESR, CBC, and thyroid hormones T3, T4, TSH. All the results were normal.

I am just taking supplements for now (i.e., l-glutamine, zinc, and Custom Probiotics' CP-1) since my doctors have no idea what is causing my discharge. I hope someone can help. Thank you.",8,"Based on the symptoms and test results provided, here are some possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible medical conditions:

1. **Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)**: Although the colonoscopy showed mild inflammation, the presence of continuous rectal discharge, abdominal pain, and diarrhea episodes suggest IBD. Further testing, such as a small intestine endoscopy or capsule endoscopy, may be necessary to rule out Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.
2. **Small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)**: The bitter taste in the mouth, abdominal pain, and bloating after eating fiber-rich foods may indicate SIBO. A breath test (e.g., lactulose or glucose breath test) can help diagnose SIBO.
3. **Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)**: The symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel movements could be indicative of IBS. A diagnosis of IBS may be considered if other conditions are ruled out.
4. **Gastrointestinal infection**: Although the stool culture and sensitivity tests were normal, a gastrointestinal infection (e.g., giardiasis) may still be present. Further stool tests or a duodenal aspirate may be necessary to rule out an infection.
5. **Malabsorption or maldigestion**: The symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea after eating certain foods may indicate malabsorption or maldigestion. Tests such as a fecal fat test or a pancreatic function test may be necessary to evaluate malabsorption.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Small intestine endoscopy or capsule endoscopy**: To evaluate the small intestine for inflammation, ulcers, or other abnormalities that may be contributing to the rectal discharge.
2. **Breath test for SIBO**: To diagnose small intestine bacterial overgrowth, which may be contributing to the symptoms.
3. **Fecal calprotectin test**: To assess the level of inflammation in the gut and monitor the effectiveness of treatment.
4. **Gastrointestinal motility test**: To evaluate the movement of food through the digestive system and rule out conditions such as gastroparesis or intestinal dysmotility.
5. **Food intolerance testing**: To identify specific foods that may be contributing to the symptoms, such as lactose or fructose intolerance.
6. **Repeat stool tests**: To rule out a gastrointestinal infection or to monitor for changes in the gut microbiome.
7. **Imaging studies (e.g., CT or MRI enterography)**: To evaluate the small intestine and rule out conditions such as intestinal obstruction or lymphoma.
8. **Consultation with a registered dietitian**: To develop a personalized diet plan that takes into account food intolerances and malabsorption, and to ensure adequate nutrition.

Justifications for each recommendation:

* The symptoms of continuous rectal discharge, abdominal pain, and diarrhea episodes suggest a gastrointestinal condition that requires further evaluation.
* The normal results from previous tests (e.g., colonoscopy, stool tests, blood work) do not rule out the possibility of other conditions, such as IBD, SIBO, or malabsorption.
* The presence of a bitter taste in the mouth and abdominal pain after eating certain foods suggests a possible gastrointestinal infection or malabsorption.
* The use of probiotics and supplements has not resolved the symptoms, indicating that further testing and evaluation are necessary to determine the underlying cause of the condition."
Took baseball to testicles. Experiencing slight pain four days now. My semen is brown.,I hurt myself when I misplayed a ball and took a 70mph to the testicles. Hurt badly for about an hour and then pain subsided. It's been a little sore since Saturday and today I noticed my semen was slightly brown. Should I be concerned?,8,"Given the symptoms, possible medical conditions that may be considered include:

1. **Testicular Trauma or Hematoma**: The direct impact to the testicles could have caused internal bleeding or a hematoma, which might lead to pain and discoloration of the semen.
2. **Testicular Rupture**: Although less likely if the pain subsided, a rupture could still be a possibility, especially if there was significant force involved.
3. **Epididymitis or Orchitis**: These are inflammations of the epididymis or testis, respectively, which could be caused by trauma or infection.
4. **Urethral Injury**: The force of the impact might have also affected the urethra, potentially causing an injury that could lead to changes in urine or semen color.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Urgent Scrotal Ultrasound**: To assess for testicular rupture, hematoma, or other structural damage. This is a non-invasive test that can provide immediate feedback on the integrity of the testicles.
2. **Urinalysis**: To check for blood in the urine, which could indicate a urethral injury or other urinary tract issues.
3. **Semen Analysis**: Given the change in semen color, analyzing its components could help identify any abnormalities, such as blood or infection.
4. **Physical Examination**: A thorough examination by a healthcare provider to assess for tenderness, swelling, or other signs of injury or infection.
5. **Blood Tests**: To check for signs of infection (e.g., elevated white blood cell count) or other systemic responses to the injury.

Justifications for these recommendations:
- The history of significant trauma to the testicles necessitates an urgent assessment to rule out serious conditions like testicular rupture.
- The change in semen color (to slightly brown) could indicate the presence of blood, which might suggest internal injury or infection.
- Given the mechanism of injury and the symptoms, it's crucial to evaluate the urinary tract for any potential damage.
- A combination of imaging, laboratory tests, and physical examination will provide a comprehensive understanding of the extent of the injury and guide appropriate management.

It is advisable to seek medical attention promptly, as some of these conditions can lead to serious complications if not addressed in a timely manner."
How do I convince my friend to seek help?,"I have been on both sides of depression.  I've always had an extremely severe anxiety disorder (GAD) and that sort of caused MDD.  Anyway, I'm much better now (yay psychotropic drugs) but my friend is not.

(17/M)  He has no hope in anything, feels lonely a lot but can't be compelled to talk to anyone.  Feels empty, hopeless, doesn't care about anyone or anything, numb.  Has been this way for about 8 months, as far as I can remember.  Other things he says include stuff like personal hygiene, getting out of bed or showering is an effort.

No self harm (that I know of)

Having been there myself, *I* think he's depressed but obviously I'm not a professional.  The thing is though, no matter what I say, either from personal experience, or just general common sense, I just can't convince him to talk to anyone but me because he doesn't like talking to people, especially about these things (he's very shy).

This all culminated in me telling him my little testimony thing, where basically I said I used to be in a state where I either had to make an active effort to get better or kill myself.  There were no other options, I couldn't stand feeling so hopeless and having 3-4 panic attacks a day, which was exhausting.  And so I told him I started in little steps.  Goal one, shower two days in a row.  etc etc, on to how much I improved once I went on medication and started regularly seeing someone.

I tried to tell him it wasn't easy, that the first day is the hardest, and yes there will be backtracks.

But his self-worth is so low that he doesn't care enough to do anything about it, and both of his parents are quite cold and clinical, and he refuses point blank to talk to them about anything.

I'm just looking for some guidance here.  I feel absolutely helpless just sticking by him.  I needed my friends to give me some tough love and start resenting me before I started to fight, but I don't want to be hard on him in case I make it worse, being his only friend and all.

Just anyone, give me an answer besides just 'be there for him.'  There has to be something.   ",8,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be affecting your friend include:

1. **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)**: Characterized by persistent feelings of hopelessness, emptiness, and a lack of interest in activities, which aligns with your friend's symptoms.
2. **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**: Although you mentioned you have GAD, your friend's symptoms of feeling overwhelmed and struggling with daily tasks may also indicate anxiety.
3. **Social Anxiety Disorder**: Your friend's shyness and reluctance to talk to people, especially about personal issues, could be a sign of social anxiety.
4. **Avoidant Personality Disorder**: The pattern of avoiding social interactions and feeling inadequate may suggest avoidant personality disorder.

To further evaluate your friend's condition, the following diagnostic tests or evaluations may be recommended:

1. **Psychological evaluation**: A comprehensive assessment by a mental health professional, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist, to determine the underlying causes of your friend's symptoms.
2. **Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) or Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)**: Standardized questionnaires to assess the severity of depressive symptoms.
3. **Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7)**: A questionnaire to evaluate the severity of anxiety symptoms.
4. **Social Anxiety Disorder assessment**: A evaluation to assess the severity of social anxiety symptoms, such as the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN).
5. **Mental status examination**: A thorough evaluation of your friend's mental state, including mood, cognition, and behavior.

As for guidance on how to support your friend, consider the following:

1. **Encourage small steps**: Help your friend set small, achievable goals, like showering or engaging in a hobby, to build confidence and momentum.
2. **Offer to accompany him to appointments**: Having a supportive friend by his side may make it easier for him to seek professional help.
3. **Help him find resources**: Provide information about local mental health services, support groups, or online resources that may be helpful.
4. **Respect his boundaries**: Avoid pushing him to talk about things he's not ready to discuss, but let him know you're there to listen when he is.
5. **Seek support for yourself**: Caring for a friend with mental health issues can be challenging, so consider seeking guidance from a mental health professional or a support group for caregivers.
6. **Explore online therapy options**: If your friend is hesitant to seek in-person help, online therapy platforms or support groups may be a more comfortable starting point.
7. **Talk to his parents (if possible)**: If you have a good relationship with his parents, you may want to encourage them to seek professional help or support for their son, while being sensitive to his feelings about their involvement.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* A comprehensive psychological evaluation is essential to determine the underlying causes of your friend's symptoms and develop an effective treatment plan.
* Standardized questionnaires and assessments can help quantify the severity of his symptoms and track progress over time.

"Not sure what happened, possibly a panic attack? IC doctor had no real answer for me.","23 / female / 5' 7'' / 130lbs / caucasian / ~24 hours / Chicago, IL / diagnosed with bipolar II at age 20 / 200mg Lamictal, 300mg Wellbutrin

Hey /r/AskDocs, I was hoping someone could shed some light on something that happened to me Monday afternoon.  I'm sorry about the wall of text that's about to follow.

I was coming back from lunch with a friend, and as soon as I stepped off the the bus, I began to feel a bit sick.  I figured I was just tired from not getting much sleep the night before, and decided to put off my errands for a quick nap.  I remember entering my apartment and then walking into my bedroom, but I have no memory of lying down on the bed.  It was like I suddenly blacked out, and when I regained consciousness, it was like I woke up in hell.  I didn't know where I was; it felt like I was in another realm entirely.  I saw colors swirling around me, like I was on a carousel that had gone out of control.  There were about ten different voices in my head at once, and I couldn't figure out which thoughts were my own.  My heart was pounding, I had a loud ringing in my ears, and I couldn't swallow.  My muscles were so tight I couldn't move.  Once I finally figured out where I was and could make out the numbers on the clock, about 45 minutes has passed since I had gotten home.  When I finally stood up, my equilibrium was so off I couldn't walk without holding the walls.  My vision was blurred, and whenever I tried to focus it was like my eyes would drift off by themselves.  I felt slightly nauseous, but that came in waves.  My heartbeat was still out of control.  It took about six hours to get back to a functional level, my vision was still blurred but I was walking okay.  My heartbeat was still pounding and the ringing in my ears had not gone down.  My throat was still very tight.  My SO got home from work close to midnight when I told him what happened, the first thing he did was try to get me to eat.  My nausea was gone but I had no appetite, and the soup he gave me seemed to have no taste.  I barely slept that night because the ringing in my ears kept me up, plus I would snap awake every time I tried to swallow. Not much had improved by the morning so we went to Immediate Care (I haven't yet found a doctor in my new city).  I told him my symptoms, he said it could be a panic attack but he wasn't sure, that I had a strange variety of symptoms.  The only thing that worried them was my pulse, my heart was still out of control.  They hooked me up to a machine to monitor my heart rate and said it was going down slowly.  There were no real answers, I probably should have gone to a hospital but all I wanted to do was lie down at that point.  It took more than 24 hours for my symptoms to vanish, and 48 hours for my heartbeat to get back to normal.  I've never had a panic attack before, is that really what this was?  Why did it last so long?  It was completely out of the blue, I just want to be able to prevent it from happening again.",8,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be considered include:

1. **Panic Attack**: The symptoms of a racing heart, tight muscles, nausea, and feelings of disorientation are consistent with a panic attack. However, the duration and severity of the symptoms are unusual for a typical panic attack.
2. **Seizure**: The sudden loss of consciousness, confusion, and disorientation could be indicative of a seizure. The visual disturbances, such as seeing colors swirling around, and the auditory hallucinations (hearing voices) also support this possibility.
3. **Migraine**: The visual disturbances, nausea, and sensitivity to sound and light could be symptoms of a migraine. However, the severity of the symptoms and the presence of a racing heart and tight muscles are not typical of a migraine.
4. **Psychotic Episode**: The auditory hallucinations and disorientation could be indicative of a psychotic episode, particularly given the patient's history of bipolar II disorder.
5. **Neurological Disorder**: The combination of symptoms, including the loss of consciousness, visual disturbances, and auditory hallucinations, could be indicative of a neurological disorder such as epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, or a brain tumor.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Electroencephalogram (EEG)**: To rule out seizure activity and evaluate brain wave patterns.
2. **Brain Imaging**: A CT or MRI scan to rule out any structural abnormalities in the brain, such as a tumor or stroke.
3. **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: To evaluate heart rhythm and rule out any cardiac abnormalities.
4. **Blood Work**: To check for any underlying medical conditions, such as anemia, infection, or electrolyte imbalances.
5. **Psychiatric Evaluation**: A thorough evaluation by a psychiatrist to assess the patient's mental status and rule out any underlying psychiatric conditions, such as a psychotic episode or a mood disorder.
6. **Neurological Examination**: A comprehensive neurological examination to evaluate the patient's cognitive function, motor function, and sensory function.
7. **Sleep Study**: To evaluate the patient's sleep patterns and rule out any sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea or narcolepsy.

Justifications for each recommendation:

* EEG and brain imaging are recommended to rule out seizure activity and structural abnormalities in the brain.
* ECG is recommended to evaluate heart rhythm and rule out any cardiac abnormalities.
* Blood work is recommended to check for any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to the symptoms.
* Psychiatric evaluation is recommended to assess the patient's mental status and rule out any underlying psychiatric conditions.
* Neurological examination is recommended to evaluate the patient's cognitive function, motor function, and sensory function.
* Sleep study is recommended to evaluate the patient's sleep patterns and rule out any sleep disorders that may be contributing to the symptoms.

It is essential to note that the patient's symptoms are complex and may require a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis and treatment. A thorough evaluation by a team of healthcare professionals, including a neurologist, psychiatrist, and primary care physician, is recommended to determine the underlying cause of the symptoms and develop an effective treatment plan."
"30/F SVT, how serious is this? What just happened to my heart?","I've been chasing symptoms for about a year now that mimicked a pheochromocytoma but the catecholamine urine test came back within normal parameters.  I have controlled HTN on lisinopril 5mg i po qd which was added when I suddenly developed HTN again after having it mysteriously resolve last year.  I also had severe issues with what I termed adrenaline, leading to sinus tachy, palpitations, and precipitating panic attacks.  Intermittant.  Increases after alcohol consumption (&gt;4 hours after drinking).  

I suddenly began experiencing palpitations again this past week and intermittent sinus tachy.  2 days ago I have palpitations constantly and yesterday my heart rate was completely erratic.  I used a HRM to count calories and while preparing for a walk it shot from 86 to 192 down to 146 down to 90 etc.  I assumed the HRM had a low battery but began feeling my heart actually speeding up and slowing down.

ER admission I was awaiting blood test results and while in the bed I felt like I had an adrenaline rush or some sort of strange sensation that immediately led to an increase in heart rate.  I yelled for the doctor and they put the EKG on me but before they could push adenosine my heart started going back down to sinus.  For the next two hours it would increase randomly and then rest around 110-120 bpm when not shooting up to 140-160.

They got the EKG and said it was clearly SVT.  My mag levels were low so they pushed 2g and lopressor 25 mg po.  After about an hour my pulse went down to the 80's and I was discharged with instructions to meet with a cardiologist to receive a referral to an EP.

I am on metoprolol 50mg i po bid,  it seems to be working fine though when it begins to wear off I feel sinus tachy again.

Clearly I have a great deal of anxiety about this.  Most resources I see indicate it isn't much of a serious condition but more of a disturbing set of symptoms.  I have no idea how that would possibly be accurate based on what happened last night.

What should I know about this?  Am I going to die?

",8,"Based on the symptoms and medical history provided, possible medical conditions that may be contributing to the symptoms include:

1. **Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)**: The ER diagnosis and EKG results confirm this condition, which is characterized by an abnormal rapid heart rhythm originating from the upper chambers of the heart.
2. **Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia (PSVT)**: This condition is a type of SVT that occurs intermittently, which aligns with the patient's symptoms of episodic palpitations and sinus tachycardia.
3. **Anxiety Disorder**: The patient's history of panic attacks and anxiety about their condition suggests an underlying anxiety disorder, which may be contributing to or exacerbating their symptoms.
4. **Pheochromocytoma or other catecholamine-related disorders**: Although the catecholamine urine test was normal, the patient's symptoms of adrenaline rushes and episodic hypertension may still suggest a catecholamine-related disorder.
5. **Electrolyte imbalance or magnesium deficiency**: The patient's low magnesium levels and response to magnesium supplementation suggest that electrolyte imbalances may be contributing to their symptoms.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Electrophysiology (EP) study**: To further evaluate the patient's SVT and assess the need for catheter ablation or other treatments.
2. **Holter monitor or event monitor**: To continuously monitor the patient's heart rhythm and detect any episodes of SVT or other arrhythmias.
3. **Echocardiogram**: To evaluate the patient's cardiac structure and function, which may help identify any underlying conditions contributing to their symptoms.
4. **Blood tests**: To monitor electrolyte levels, including magnesium, potassium, and calcium, and to assess for any other underlying conditions that may be contributing to their symptoms.
5. **Anxiety disorder evaluation**: To assess the patient's anxiety symptoms and develop a treatment plan to manage their anxiety, which may help alleviate their symptoms.
6. **Catecholamine panel**: To re-evaluate the patient's catecholamine levels, as some conditions may have variable or intermittent catecholamine production.
7. **Genetic testing**: To evaluate for any genetic conditions that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms, such as long QT syndrome or other channelopathies.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* The patient's symptoms and medical history suggest a complex condition that requires further evaluation and monitoring.
* The EP study and Holter monitor or event monitor will help diagnose and characterize the patient's SVT and assess the need for treatment.
* The echocardiogram and blood tests will help evaluate the patient's cardiac structure and function and identify any underlying conditions contributing to their symptoms.
* The anxiety disorder evaluation and treatment will help manage the patient's anxiety symptoms, which may be exacerbating their condition.
* The catecholamine panel and genetic testing will help evaluate for any underlying conditions that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

Regarding the patient's concern about dying, SVT is generally not a life-threatening condition, but it can be disturbing and affect quality of life. With proper treatment and management, the patient's symptoms can be controlled, and their risk of complications can be minimized. However, it is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition and adjusting their treatment plan as needed to ensure the best possible outcome."

"Is it possible for a large (and I mean very large) mole that was once tested as Benign, to still become cancerous? Or am I just being paranoid.","19(almost), Male

6ft, 183cm

216lbs, 98kg

Caucasian, Mostly German Descent

Living in BC Canada

Left Ankle, Outside


So Since birth, I've had a large mole on the outside of my Left ankle, and when I say large, I'm not talking size-of-a-dime, I'm talking size of a Loonie (Canadian 1 dollar coin) which is roughly an inch in diameter. See below. As far as irregularities, there aren't really any. Again see below. Regardless, about four or five years back we went to a doctor in another town, I don't remember what kind of doctor he was, possibly pediatrician? He recommended it be removed, obviously, but as an alternative he said it would be possible to do what he called a ""shave biopsy"" wherein they slice off the top layer of the Mole and test it for cancers and such. I was (and still am) terrified of surgery/operations, having never needed any, and having a phobia of anything medical. Likewise, I opted for the Shave as opposed to removal. They did the biopsy and the results said that the mole was benign, so off we went and I had to endure frequently changing the bandage on the sucker as it bled a lot. Time has gone by and what we expected would happen was that when it healed, it would just be a pink scar. Instead, it came back, almost exactly as it had been before. Round, Dark brown and smooth. Although now it's ever so slightly raised (perhaps scar tissue?). In the last four or five years, it really hasn't changed much at all. At least not enough for me to notice. That being said, I recently began to wonder whether it was possible it could still be a threat, and around the same time I started to notice (maybe?) a dull ache in the area. I'm trying to convince myself it's just a sort of nocebo effect brought on simply by thinking about it to much, and that it's not anything to worry about. That I'm just being paranoid. That being said, it never hurts to ask a professional, just in case. That and it would put my mind to rest - at least, that is, if it IS benign. Anyway, here's some pictures of the monster for your viewing (dis)pleasure: [images](http://imgur.com/a/f8c6I)",8,"Based on the symptoms and history provided, here are possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible Medical Conditions:

1. **Melanoma or other skin cancer**: Although the previous biopsy result was benign, the mole's persistence and slight changes (e.g., raised appearance) warrant further investigation.
2. **Congenital melanocytic nevus**: A benign mole present at birth, which may have a higher risk of developing into melanoma.
3. **Dysplastic nevus**: A type of mole that can be precancerous and may require monitoring or removal.

Recommended Diagnostic Tests or Evaluations:

1. **Dermatological examination**: A thorough examination by a dermatologist to assess the mole's size, shape, color, and texture, as well as any changes since the previous biopsy.
2. **Biopsy (punch or excisional)**: A new biopsy to re-evaluate the mole's histology, as the previous shave biopsy may not have been sufficient to rule out cancer.
3. **Imaging studies (e.g., ultrasound or MRI)**: To assess the mole's depth and any potential involvement of underlying tissues.
4. **Full-body skin examination**: To check for any other suspicious moles or skin lesions.
5. **Genetic counseling**: If the mole is diagnosed as a congenital melanocytic nevus, genetic counseling may be recommended to discuss the risk of melanoma and other potential complications.

Justifications for each recommendation:

* A dermatological examination is necessary to assess the mole's current state and any changes since the previous biopsy.
* A new biopsy is recommended to re-evaluate the mole's histology, as the previous shave biopsy may not have been sufficient to rule out cancer.
* Imaging studies can help assess the mole's depth and any potential involvement of underlying tissues, which may be relevant for surgical planning or monitoring.
* A full-body skin examination can help identify any other suspicious moles or skin lesions that may require attention.
* Genetic counseling may be relevant if the mole is diagnosed as a congenital melanocytic nevus, as this can help discuss the risk of melanoma and other potential complications.

It is essential to consult a dermatologist or a primary care physician to discuss these recommendations and determine the best course of action. They will evaluate the mole and medical history to provide personalized guidance and reassurance."
Diagnosis challenge! What's wrong with my 8 year old son? It's been 3 years!,"Hi friendly docs of reddit! 

It's been over three years since my son (super cool kid, doesn't complain, silly, blue eyes, likes dragons, Star Wars, and teasing his sisters) began displaying symptoms, and we still don't have a diagnosis. Do you guys have any ideas?

He was a happy go-lucky little boy with normal development until age five when he began showing difficulty keeping up with his peers on the playground, with handwriting, and with extreme fatigue. After school he would often come home, sleep until dinner time, when we'd wake him to eat, and then he'd go right back to sleep until the next morning.

He now sees a neurologist, the only ped neuro in our state, but we still have no diagnosis. 

The little dude:
8 yo Male
Caucasian
76 lbs 
4'9
Medications: Gabapentin 400-500 mg per day, taken before bed. Concerta 27 mg per day in the morning

Symptoms present since 5 yrs old
 
Symptoms:
Chronic headaches, ADHD, parasthesia, fatigue, insomnia, RLS, weakness, eczema, normal cognitive skills, but he is developmentally delayed in his fine and gross motor skills by 2-3 years, and has intermittent pain in his hands and legs, some sensory issues, intermittent vision problems, eye pain, neck pain. He has been very depressed lately. He appears generally physically weak, and has a sort of clumsy gait when walking. Most pronounced is the appearance of his hands which seem almost babyish compared to his peers. Test preformed by his occupational therapist indicate he is in the 4th percentile for strength, coordination, etc. 

He has had two MRI's of his brain and spine, with the only remarkable finding being a 2-5 mm in diameter syrinx in his cervical spine from C4-C7. I was told the syrinx was likely an incidental finding and wouldn't account for his symptoms. He also has some ""minor thickening of the bone"" in his lower spine. They have ruled out tether cord syndrome, chiari malformation, spina bifida and all of his blood work comes back normal, and it doesn't appear to be MS, and muscular dystrophy seems to fit, but most of the symptoms he has are different--i.e., his hands were affected first. 

His doc says the next step is a muscle biopsy sometime in the next year year, as well as another MRI in that same time frame. My concern is that he is getting weaker, and we could potentially be doing more than treating symptoms, but without a diagnosis, there's no treatment.  I don't know if I should push him to work harder physically or if that is just causing more pain and damage for him. What if this disease is irreversible and it's something he could be treated for now? What if it's fatal and I'm wasting precious time with him at medical facilities!?
 

Thanks in advance for any help!  I sometimes wish there were an IRL version of House I could take him to see. 

Keep fighting the good fight! ",7,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be considered include:

1. **Muscular Dystrophy**: Although the symptoms don't entirely fit, the weakness, fatigue, and developmental delays in fine and gross motor skills could be indicative of a muscular dystrophy subtype.
2. **Mitochondrial Myopathies**: The combination of fatigue, weakness, and developmental delays, along with the presence of a syrinx in the cervical spine, could suggest a mitochondrial myopathy.
3. **Neuromuscular Disorders**: Conditions such as spinal muscular atrophy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, or other neuromuscular disorders could be considered, given the weakness, fatigue, and sensory issues.
4. **Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome**: The presence of joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility, along with the syrinx and minor thickening of the bone, could suggest Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.
5. **Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)**: The symptoms of weakness, fatigue, and sensory issues, along with the presence of a syrinx, could be indicative of CIDP.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Muscle Biopsy**: As already planned, a muscle biopsy can help diagnose muscular dystrophy, mitochondrial myopathies, or other neuromuscular disorders.
2. **Genetic Testing**: Genetic testing for muscular dystrophy, mitochondrial myopathies, and other neuromuscular disorders can help identify specific genetic mutations.
3. **Electromyography (EMG) and Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS)**: These tests can help evaluate muscle and nerve function, which can be useful in diagnosing neuromuscular disorders.
4. **Mitochondrial Function Tests**: Tests such as lactate and pyruvate levels, or a muscle biopsy with mitochondrial function analysis, can help diagnose mitochondrial myopathies.
5. **Orthopedic Evaluation**: An orthopedic evaluation can help assess joint mobility, muscle strength, and overall musculoskeletal function.
6. **Ophthalmologic Evaluation**: An ophthalmologic evaluation can help assess vision problems and eye pain.
7. **Psychological Evaluation**: A psychological evaluation can help assess depression and cognitive function.
8. **Sleep Study**: A sleep study can help evaluate sleep patterns and diagnose sleep disorders such as restless leg syndrome.
9. **Cardiology Evaluation**: A cardiology evaluation can help assess cardiac function, as some neuromuscular disorders can affect the heart.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* The combination of symptoms, including weakness, fatigue, and developmental delays, suggests a neuromuscular or muscular disorder.
* The presence of a syrinx in the cervical spine and minor thickening of the bone in the lower spine requires further evaluation.
* Genetic testing and muscle biopsy can help diagnose specific genetic mutations or muscular disorders.
* Electromyography and nerve conduction studies can help evaluate muscle and nerve function.
* Mitochondrial function tests can help diagnose mitochondrial myopathies.
* Orthopedic, ophthalmologic, psychological, and cardiology evaluations can help assess overall musculoskeletal, vision, cognitive, and cardiac function.

It is essential to work closely with the pediatric neurologist and other specialists to determine the best course of action and to prioritize the most critical tests and evaluations."
What is this red bump on my arm?,"I have had it for a few month, and it doesn't look like any pimple I have ever had but I could be wrong. Its almost cloudy looking upclose. 

http://i.imgur.com/Ux5OauD.jpg

I'm a 16 male in New Jersey if that helps. Thanks.",7,"Based on the symptoms and the image provided, here are some possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible medical conditions:

1. **Basal cell carcinoma**: Although rare in teenagers, this type of skin cancer can present as a cloudy or pearly nodule.
2. **Keratosis pilaris**: A harmless condition characterized by small, rough patches on the skin, which can sometimes appear cloudy or white.
3. **Sebaceous hyperplasia**: A benign condition where the sebaceous glands become enlarged, leading to small, cloudy or yellowish bumps on the skin.
4. **Milia**: Small, white or cloudy bumps that occur when keratin, a protein, becomes trapped under the skin.
5. **Acne**: Although you mentioned it doesn't look like a typical pimple, it's still possible that it's a form of acne, such as a closed comedone or a papule.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Dermatological examination**: A doctor, preferably a dermatologist, should examine the lesion in person to assess its size, shape, color, and texture.
2. **Biopsy**: If the doctor suspects a malignant or pre-malignant condition, a biopsy may be necessary to examine the tissue under a microscope.
3. **Wood's lamp examination**: This test uses ultraviolet light to help diagnose conditions like vitiligo, melanoma, or fungal infections.
4. **Skin scraping or swab**: To rule out fungal or bacterial infections, a skin scraping or swab may be taken for culture or microscopy.
5. **Imaging studies**: If the doctor suspects a deeper underlying condition, such as a cyst or tumor, imaging studies like ultrasound or MRI may be ordered.

Justifications for each recommendation:

* A dermatological examination is essential to assess the lesion's characteristics and determine the best course of action.
* A biopsy is necessary if the doctor suspects a malignant or pre-malignant condition, as it provides a definitive diagnosis.
* A Wood's lamp examination can help diagnose conditions that may not be visible under normal light.
* Skin scraping or swab can help identify fungal or bacterial infections, which may require specific treatments.
* Imaging studies may be necessary to rule out deeper underlying conditions that may not be visible on the surface.

As a 16-year-old male in New Jersey, it's essential to consult a doctor or dermatologist to determine the cause of the lesion and receive proper treatment. They will be able to assess the lesion in person and order the necessary diagnostic tests to provide an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan."
"Hey doctors, can you explain to me what happened to her?","My family friend's daughter is 13, but her abilities are like those of a two year old. Here's how the story goes...

So this little girl, K, was a normal girl. She grew up normally, developed normally, had friends and a great social life, and even learned how to play the piano on her own at the age of 5. When K was 6, she developed a fever and her temperature was said to be incredibly high. Her parents took her to the hospital, but the nurses neglected to place her in a room or give her any attention until a couple of hours later. By then, she passed out and I believe she was placed in a coma. After she woke up, she was no longer the intelligent little girl that her parents knew. She could no longer walk, no longer move, no longer talk, and no longer had any bladder control. Her parents chose to not place charges against the hospital for negligence. 
After years of therapy, she was able to walk and move around. Now she's 13, and she wears diapers even though her parents have tried to potty train her again. She cannot talk to have a conversation, but she is aware of when she needs her diaper changed and she does understand when we tell her to come eat. For example, when she needs to have her diaper changed, she would constantly repeat ""Diaper. Diaper. Diaper."" over and over again until it's changed. She laughs when anything she finds funny happens (like when I trip over something or when her mom makes a funny face at her) and she knows how to operate the iPad to watch children's nursery songs on YouTube. She walks and runs with her back bent forward, exactly like how Genie the feral child does. 

I feel as if she is aware of everything that is going on and understands everything that we say, but she just doesn't know how to communicate back to us that she understands. She has been going to school like normal, but when I give her a pencil and paper, she slouches away from the pencil in disgust.
Can anyone here explain to me what exactly happened from when she was hit with the fever to the results? Did the fever cause her to have brain or neural damage? I am just curious as to what happened in the hospital that caused a developmental reversal such as this.",7,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may have contributed to K's developmental reversal include:

1. **Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE)**: This condition occurs when the brain is deprived of oxygen, which can happen during a prolonged fever, especially if medical attention is delayed. HIE can cause significant brain damage, leading to cognitive, motor, and speech impairments.
2. **Acquired Brain Injury (ABI)**: ABI can result from a variety of causes, including infection, inflammation, or trauma. In K's case, the high fever and subsequent coma may have caused ABI, leading to her developmental regression.
3. **Encephalitis**: This is an inflammation of the brain, often caused by a viral or bacterial infection. Encephalitis can cause significant brain damage, particularly if left untreated or if treatment is delayed.
4. **Septic Encephalopathy**: This condition occurs when a severe infection, such as sepsis, affects the brain, leading to cognitive and motor impairments.

To further evaluate K's condition, the following diagnostic tests or evaluations may be recommended:

1. **MRI or CT scan of the brain**: To assess the extent of any brain damage or abnormalities, such as scarring, atrophy, or lesions.
2. **Electroencephalogram (EEG)**: To evaluate K's brain activity and detect any abnormal electrical activity, which may indicate seizure disorders or other neurological conditions.
3. **Neuropsychological evaluation**: To assess K's cognitive, emotional, and behavioral functioning, including her attention, memory, language, and problem-solving abilities.
4. **Speech and language therapy evaluation**: To assess K's communication skills and develop strategies to improve her language abilities.
5. **Occupational therapy evaluation**: To assess K's daily living skills, such as self-care, feeding, and mobility, and develop strategies to improve her independence.
6. **Genetic testing**: To rule out any underlying genetic conditions that may have contributed to K's developmental regression.
7. **Review of medical records**: To investigate the circumstances surrounding K's hospitalization and treatment, including any potential medical errors or negligence.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* Imaging studies (MRI or CT scan) can help identify any structural brain abnormalities that may have contributed to K's developmental regression.
* EEG can help detect any abnormal brain activity that may be contributing to K's cognitive and motor impairments.
* Neuropsychological, speech and language, and occupational therapy evaluations can provide a comprehensive understanding of K's strengths and weaknesses, informing the development of targeted interventions to support her development and independence.
* Genetic testing can help rule out any underlying genetic conditions that may have contributed to K's developmental regression.
* Review of medical records can provide valuable information about the circumstances surrounding K's hospitalization and treatment, which may inform future medical decisions and interventions.

It is essential to note that K's condition is complex and likely multifactorial, and a comprehensive evaluation by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals is necessary to develop an accurate diagnosis and effective treatment plan."

   - Recommended test: Psychological evaluation or screening for mental health disorders.
   - Justification: Given the patient's age and the subjective nature of the complaint, ruling out mental health issues is a reasonable first step.

2. **Sleep Disorders**: Poor sleep quality or disorders like insomnia can lead to feelings of being unwell or concerns about one's brain health.
   - Recommended test: Sleep diary or actigraphy to assess sleep patterns.
   - Justification: Sleep issues are common and can significantly impact how one feels, both physically and mentally.

3. **Nutritional Deficiencies**: Deficiencies in vitamins like B12 or other nutrients can cause neurological symptoms, including feelings of malaise or concerns about one's brain.
   - Recommended test: Blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies (e.g., B12, D) and other nutritional markers.
   - Justification: Nutritional deficiencies are relatively easy to test for and can have a significant impact on health.

4. **Hypothyroidism**: An underactive thyroid gland can cause feelings of being unwell, fatigue, and concerns about cognitive function.
   - Recommended test: Thyroid function tests (TSH, free T4).
   - Justification: Hypothyroidism is a common condition that can cause a variety of non-specific symptoms.

5. **Substance Use**: Though not mentioned, substance use can affect brain function and overall health.
   - Recommended evaluation: Substance use screening.
   - Justification: Given the patient's age, it's a relevant consideration, even if not immediately apparent.

6. **Neurological Conditions**: Conditions like migraines, epilepsy, or multiple sclerosis can cause concerns about brain health, though they typically present with more specific symptoms.
   - Recommended test: Depending on the presence of other symptoms, tests like an EEG or MRI might be considered, but these would be more appropriate after an initial evaluation and based on specific findings.
   - Justification: These conditions are less likely without specific symptoms but should be considered in a comprehensive evaluation.

Given the patient's lack of insurance and desire to avoid unnecessary medical expenses, a stepwise approach starting with the least invasive and least expensive evaluations (like a psychological evaluation, sleep assessment, and basic blood work for nutritional deficiencies and thyroid function) would be prudent. If these initial evaluations do not reveal a cause for the patient's concerns, further testing could be considered based on the findings and the patient's specific symptoms and risk factors."
Why does my face look like this when I wake up some mornings?,"http://imgur.com/a/CH89h

(1st image swollen puffiness? 2nd image to show normal)

Both images taken within a week of one another.  

I do have hypothyroid, is it just a side effect of that?  

I've always noticed my face to have largely noticeable difference sometimes for several days at a time (at least to me, maybe i'm just over analyzing myself).  It is much worse in the mornings like shown in the first image, but my face will be slightly puffy for a few days at a time throughout the day.  My entire face seems to swell; lips, area around eyes, cheeks, area beneath jaw line.  

Thanks.

Recurring chest pain and breathlessness: heart attack?,"21, F, 5'6"", 96 lbs, caucasian, Europe, IBS, no current treatment.

Hello,

The symptoms started last summer. It was predominantly trouble breathing at first, and diffuse pain in my chest/left arms/jaw/back then and nausea. After a few days of daily massage with a camphor cream, the pain disappeared. I would conclude it was some entangled nerves or something. I decided not to consult a doctor even though that impression of breathlessness persisted. The symptoms above actually lasted a few hours at most and I experienced about 3 of these episodes per day. Then, the symptoms magically disappeared at the end of the summer, except for nausea, which lasted another few months until I stop eating dairy products (possible lactose intolerance?). I had a few episodes of breathlessness in November/December, but they would usually disappear quickly. I guess at this point I concluded it was merely stress. In February, I started to have a pain similar to my chest pain, but in my left knee. It is similar in the way the pain comes and goes quickly, I feel it ""rise"" and it lingers for a few seconds before disappearing. I also noticed the same pain in the lower part of the ribcage. Just like for chest pain, I don't necessarily have to move to experience it. 

Anyway, about a month ago, I was in the shower when I started feeling incredibly weak, it felt like I couldn't quite catch my breath and my vision started turning black. I checked my pulse after the incident: it was normal again, but within the hour, the trouble breathing/pinching sensation in my heart started to become more and more unpleasant, and I started to feel a tingling sensation in my hands. I called 911, the doctor told me it was probably just a panic attack but considering how thin I am, he finally told me to drive to the hospital for some tests. So, I ended up having a EKG, a complete blood panel as well as a lung radiography and everything turned out to be normal, so they told me to go home. Following that, I had many intense episodes during which I thought I was dying, but as I previously said they usually last an hour or so. Now it's been two days I feel considerably worse in the sense the chest and back pain and breathlessness don't go away anymore. I haven't even been able to sleep more than a few hours here and there. I'm quite worried about my health, but don't really want to go at the ER again for 'nothing'. Do you think it presents an emergency? 

Thanks for reading, and for possible advice. 
",7,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be considered include:

1. **Cardiac conditions**: The chest pain, shortness of breath, and palpitations could be indicative of cardiac issues such as myocarditis, pericarditis, or cardiomyopathy.
2. **Anxiety or panic disorder**: The episodes of intense fear, breathlessness, and tingling sensations in the hands could be symptoms of anxiety or panic disorder.
3. **Gastrointestinal issues**: The nausea, possible lactose intolerance, and IBS could be related to gastrointestinal problems such as gastroparesis, inflammatory bowel disease, or celiac disease.
4. **Neurological conditions**: The diffuse pain, numbness, and tingling sensations could be indicative of neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, or neuropathy.
5. **Connective tissue disorders**: The joint pain, chest pain, and breathlessness could be symptoms of connective tissue disorders such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis.
6. **Pulmonary embolism or pneumothorax**: Although the lung radiography was normal, it's essential to consider these conditions, especially given the sudden onset of shortness of breath and chest pain.
7. **Nutritional deficiencies**: The patient's low weight and possible lactose intolerance could be indicative of nutritional deficiencies such as vitamin B12 or iron deficiency anemia.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Repeat EKG and cardiac enzymes**: To rule out cardiac conditions such as myocarditis or pericarditis.
2. **Echocardiogram**: To evaluate cardiac function and structure.
3. **Stress test or treadmill test**: To assess cardiac function under stress.
4. **Chest CT scan**: To rule out pulmonary embolism or pneumothorax.
5. **Blood tests**: To check for nutritional deficiencies, inflammatory markers, and autoimmune disorders.
6. **Gastrointestinal evaluation**: To investigate gastrointestinal issues such as gastroparesis or inflammatory bowel disease.
7. **Neurological evaluation**: To assess for neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis or neuropathy.
8. **Psychological evaluation**: To evaluate for anxiety or panic disorder.
9. **Sleep study**: To assess for sleep disorders such as sleep apnea.
10. **Referral to a specialist**: Such as a cardiologist, gastroenterologist, or rheumatologist, depending on the suspected underlying condition.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* The patient's symptoms are complex and multifaceted, requiring a comprehensive evaluation to determine the underlying cause.
* The patient's low weight and possible nutritional deficiencies may be contributing to their symptoms.
* The episodes of shortness of breath, chest pain, and palpitations require immediate attention to rule out life-threatening conditions such as cardiac or pulmonary issues.
* The patient's history of IBS and possible lactose intolerance suggests a potential gastrointestinal component to their symptoms.
* The neurological symptoms such as numbness and tingling sensations require further evaluation to determine the underlying cause.

Given the patient's worsening symptoms and inability to sleep, it is essential to seek medical attention promptly. While the patient may be hesitant to return to the ER, it is crucial to prioritize their health and seek further evaluation to determine the underlying cause of their symptoms."
My wife has mild but worsening symptoms that our doctors can't diagnose,"EDIT:  Formatting and clarify list - plus medical history at bottom

Any ideas on what to have our doctors look into would be greatly appreciated.


My wife has been experiencing these symptoms for many years, but in the past 2 years they have become significantly worse in both frequency and intensity.  We have seen several doctors but they all are at a loss and seem very unconcerned since none of her symptoms are particularly terrible - however, they are pretty drastically affecting her daily life.  If anyone has any idea about things to look into and ask her doctor about, we would be forever grateful.


She's 27, 5'3"", 120 lbs.  White, southern california, no current diagnosed issues and no medication.  Up until this last year, when she hasn't been able to because of symptoms, she was very active.  Gym 2x/week, and she dances and choreographs for a living.  She still choreographs and is fairly active despite her difficulties, but less so than before.



**Symptoms:**

* Numbness in fingers, nose, and lips when active or resting (comes and goes, but happens a few times a week and can last all day)
* Feeling faint and dizzy (but has not actually fainted) when active or resting
* Shortness of breath
* Irregular heartbeats (she says it feels like it pauses, and then ""ker-thumps"")
* Extremely tired and fatigued (about 80% of the time)
* Frequently losing her balance when active or resting (she says she feels like she loses her balance sometimes when she's sitting or laying down, which is odd)
* Feeling ""hazy"" in her body
* Heartbeat often slow when she's physically active or very fast when she's resting
* Though she is often sleepy, she sometimes has trouble sleeping through the night or falling asleep - takes melatonin or Zzzquil on occasion, which helps.  Maybe 2x a week for the past 2 months. Not sure if relevant.
* Very frequent muscle twitches - especially in left eye and in fingers



**Things the doctors have checked:**

* Basic blood work - she's not anemic, her electrolytes are normal, not diabetic, and anything else that would come up in that test was normal.  Vitamins B and D were good.
* They gave her an event heart monitor for a month - the doctor thought there may be a structural issue with her heart.  She recorded several episodes but they all were deemed normal and not a heart problem.  
* Heart echo (ultrasound) - normal 
* EKG and stress test - monitored her heart at rest and on the treadmill, normal
* blood pressure, heart rate and breath rate are all within normal range - we have a blood pressure doodad at home and tracked it throughout the day for a couple months, as well as checking at every doctor visit - all normal
* MRI to check for seizures or unusual brain stuff, normal
* given anxiety medication by the neurologist that did not help, went to see a psychologist who did not think she was anxious or had any other mental issue
* tried cutting caffeine from her diet, eating very healthy, doctor had suggested more salt in her diet (?) so we tried that for a while, she drinks plenty of water every day, and keeps her sleep schedule regular (though often so tired/fatigued that she naps during the day as well)



Does anyone have any suggestions about things to look into at this point?  We don't know what else to ask the doctors about, and none of our friends and acquaintances have any ideas.




Thank you so much.



* Not sure if relevant - she and her twin were born very early, given steroids before even born to fully develop their lungs.  Both her brother and her sister have asthma, though she was never diagnosed with it.
 
",7,"Based on the symptoms described, here are some possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

**Possible Medical Conditions:**

1. **Autonomic Dysfunction**: The symptoms of numbness, dizziness, fainting, and irregular heartbeats suggest a potential issue with the autonomic nervous system, which regulates various bodily functions.
2. **Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)**: The combination of symptoms such as dizziness, fainting, and irregular heartbeats, particularly when changing positions, may indicate POTS.
3. **Mitral Valve Prolapse**: The irregular heartbeats and feeling of a ""ker-thump"" could be related to a mitral valve prolapse, which may not have been detected on previous tests.
4. **Anxiety or Panic Disorder**: Although the psychologist did not think anxiety was a primary issue, it's possible that anxiety or panic disorder could be contributing to some of the symptoms.
5. **Hypothyroidism**: Fatigue, muscle twitches, and numbness could be related to hypothyroidism, which may not have been detected on previous blood work.
6. **Electrolyte Imbalance**: Despite normal electrolyte levels on previous tests, it's possible that there may be an underlying issue with electrolyte regulation, particularly given the symptoms of muscle twitches and numbness.
7. **Neuromuscular Disorder**: The muscle twitches and numbness could be related to a neuromuscular disorder, such as myasthenia gravis or peripheral neuropathy.

**Recommended Diagnostic Tests or Evaluations:**

1. **Tilt Table Test**: To evaluate the body's response to changes in position and detect potential autonomic dysfunction or POTS.
2. **Holter Monitor**: A 24-hour or 48-hour heart monitor to detect any irregular heartbeats or arrhythmias that may not have been detected on previous tests.
3. **Echocardiogram with Doppler**: To further evaluate the heart's structure and function, particularly the mitral valve.
4. **Thyroid Function Tests**: To rule out hypothyroidism, including TSH, free T4, and free T3 tests.
5. **Electrolyte Panel**: To re-evaluate electrolyte levels, including potassium, sodium, and magnesium.
6. **Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS) and Electromyography (EMG)**: To evaluate the function of nerves and muscles, particularly if a neuromuscular disorder is suspected.
7. **Autonomic Function Tests**: Such as heart rate variability (HRV) testing or sympathetic skin response (SSR) testing to evaluate autonomic nervous system function.
8. **Sleep Study**: To evaluate sleep patterns and detect any underlying sleep disorders that may be contributing to fatigue and other symptoms.

**Medical History:**

* Born prematurely and given steroids before birth to develop lungs
* Twin brother and sister have asthma, but she was never diagnosed with it

These factors may be relevant to the current symptoms, particularly if there is an underlying issue with lung function or autonomic nervous system development. It's essential to discuss these factors with the doctor and consider how they may be related to the current symptoms."
"46 yr old female, second time with shingles...what is going on with me? Everyone says I am too young for this.","I'm 46 and have just broken out in shingles along my ear.  I also had shingles when I was 30, all up and down my arm and hand.  Everyone says I am too young to be getting shingles, so what is causing it?  I have been told I have insulin resistance, but not much was done for it.  I also had mono in college but was dismissed as a ""hysterical female"" when u went to the doctor and he checked my iron level and said I was absolutely fine.  I was exhausted and could to make it to class, I hurt all over, he said I was like most females who freaked out with sniffles.  I ended up unofficially withdrawing from just about every class that semester.  Years later I had to have an EBV titter done since I was working for urologists and needed to get my Hep series of injections done and it came back showing insanely high EBV levels...determined to have been a past infection...probably when I was a ""hysterical female"".  Could that have messed up my immune system?  Where do I go from here?  Thanks ",7,"Based on your symptoms and medical history, here are some possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible medical conditions:

1. **Recurrent shingles**: Your history of shingles at 30 and now at 46 suggests a potential underlying issue with your immune system.
2. **Chronic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection**: Your high EBV titers indicate a past infection, which could be contributing to your immune system dysfunction.
3. **Insulin resistance and potential metabolic syndrome**: Your insulin resistance diagnosis, combined with recurrent shingles, may indicate a link between your metabolic health and immune system function.
4. **Autoimmune disorders**: Your history of mono, high EBV titers, and recurrent shingles could suggest an underlying autoimmune disorder, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Complete Blood Count (CBC) and blood chemistry tests**: To assess your overall immune system function, liver and kidney function, and metabolic health.
2. **EBV PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test**: To determine if you have an active EBV infection, which could be contributing to your shingles and immune system dysfunction.
3. **Vitamin D level test**: Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to immune system dysfunction and increased risk of shingles.
4. **Thyroid function tests**: To assess your thyroid function, as thyroid disorders can contribute to immune system dysfunction and increase the risk of shingles.
5. **Immunoglobulin tests**: To evaluate your immune system's antibody response and potential immunodeficiency.
6. **Metabolic syndrome screening**: To assess your risk of developing metabolic syndrome, which includes insulin resistance, high blood pressure, and dyslipidemia.
7. **Autoantibody tests**: To screen for autoimmune disorders, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis.
8. **Consultation with an immunologist or infectious disease specialist**: To further evaluate your immune system function and potential underlying conditions contributing to your recurrent shingles.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* Your history of recurrent shingles and high EBV titers suggests an underlying immune system dysfunction, which warrants further evaluation.
* Insulin resistance and potential metabolic syndrome may be contributing to your immune system dysfunction, making it essential to assess your metabolic health.
* Autoimmune disorders can increase the risk of shingles and immune system dysfunction, making it necessary to screen for these conditions.
* Vitamin D deficiency and thyroid disorders can contribute to immune system dysfunction, making it essential to assess these factors.

Next steps:

1. Schedule a consultation with your primary care physician to discuss your symptoms and medical history.
2. Request a referral to an immunologist or infectious disease specialist for further evaluation and guidance.
3. Consider seeking a second opinion from a healthcare provider who is knowledgeable about EBV and immune system dysfunction.
4. Keep a symptom journal to track any changes or patterns in your symptoms, which can help your healthcare provider better understand your condition."
Super intense headaches while masturbating,Hi 16 year old 180 pound white boy here. Quite often when I jack off I get a super massive headache on the left side of my head. Thee headache comes on quite suddenly and usually only goes away after an hour. If anyone could give me an explanation or advice I'd really appreciate it.,7,"Based on the symptoms described, here are possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible Medical Conditions:
1. **Migraine**: The sudden onset of a severe headache on one side of the head, triggered by physical activity (in this case, masturbation), is consistent with migraine symptoms.
2. **Cluster Headache**: Although less common, cluster headaches can be triggered by physical activity and are characterized by severe, one-sided pain.
3. **Benign Exertional Headache**: This condition is caused by physical exertion and can be triggered by activities that increase intracranial pressure, such as masturbation.
4. **Sexual Headache (Coital Cephalalgia)**: This is a rare condition characterized by headaches that occur during or after sexual activity, including masturbation.

Recommended Diagnostic Tests or Evaluations:
1. **Detailed Medical History**: A doctor will ask questions about the headaches, including frequency, duration, and any potential triggers or relieving factors.
2. **Physical Examination**: A thorough physical examination, including a neurological examination, to rule out any underlying conditions that may be contributing to the headaches.
3. **Imaging Studies**: A doctor may order imaging studies such as:
	* **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)**: To rule out any structural abnormalities in the brain that may be causing the headaches.
	* **CT (Computed Tomography) Scan**: To evaluate for any potential causes of the headaches, such as a tumor or vascular malformation.
4. **Lifestyle and Trigger Assessment**: A doctor may ask questions about the patient's lifestyle, including diet, sleep patterns, and stress levels, to identify potential triggers or contributing factors.
5. **Neurological Evaluation**: A doctor may perform a neurological evaluation to assess for any abnormalities in the nervous system that may be contributing to the headaches.
6. **Referral to a Specialist**: If the headaches are severe or persistent, a doctor may refer the patient to a neurologist or headache specialist for further evaluation and treatment.

Justifications for these recommendations:
* A detailed medical history and physical examination are essential to understand the patient's symptoms and rule out any underlying conditions.
* Imaging studies, such as MRI or CT scans, can help identify any structural abnormalities that may be causing the headaches.
* A lifestyle and trigger assessment can help identify potential triggers or contributing factors, such as stress or certain foods.
* A neurological evaluation can help assess for any abnormalities in the nervous system that may be contributing to the headaches.
* Referral to a specialist may be necessary if the headaches are severe or persistent, or if the patient requires specialized care and treatment."
The Mystery of the Buzzing Anus,"So apparently, somebody shoved a cell phone set on vibrate up my butt, and is calling it approximately every 15 seconds for the last two weeks. It's driving me nuts.

In truth, there's no phone up there, the buzzing is just like a phone. Actually, closer to one of those TENS units a PT would use. It starts every 15 seconds, comes on gradually, buzzes hard for about three seconds, and then lays off. The sensation is inside my anus, approximately where I'd imagine my sphincter to be. This occurs all day, no matter what position I'm in, for the last two weeks. Even while I'm sleeping.

I thought it might be a hemorrhoid. I've never had one before. But no bleeding, no itching, not really any problems with pooping. I am going a little more frequently, I think because of the extra stimulation down there, but not having any trouble with it. I tried a suppository, eating high fiber and prep H -- no change.

My next theory is that it's related to my back. I have a history of back problems. Bulging l4/l5 + annular tear. Sometimes it acts up. Currently I do not have any back pain or sciatica. But perhaps this is a nerve issue that is somehow related? Traction and my typical back exercises have had no effect.

* Any thoughts on what it is?
* Should I bother going to a doctor? [I am fully insured, but my doctor usually just shrugs his shoulders at random crap like this.]

Thanks!

*edit:* Okay, the buzzing was driving me insane today so I made a doctor's appointment and went. The doctor literally had zero idea what it could be, had never heard of anything like it, and said that it would probably maybe just go away in a few weeks. 

SIGH. Once again, doctors are great if you're bleeding out on the table, but if you have something minor wrong with your body that might lead you to eventually off yourself, they really don't give a shit.

I guess going to a colon specialist is my next move. Do they have colon specialists?",7,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be causing the buzzing sensation in the anus include:

1. **Anal sphincter spasms**: The sensation of buzzing or vibrating in the anus, particularly in the area of the sphincter, could be related to muscle spasms or contractions.
2. **Pudendal nerve irritation**: The pudendal nerve runs from the lower back to the pelvic area and can cause sensations of buzzing, numbness, or pain in the anus, perineum, or genital area if irritated.
3. **Proctalgia fugax**: This condition is characterized by recurring, brief episodes of anal pain or discomfort, which can be accompanied by sensations of buzzing or vibrating.
4. **Levator ani syndrome**: This condition involves spasms or contractions of the levator ani muscle, which can cause sensations of buzzing, pain, or discomfort in the anus or pelvic area.
5. **Neurological disorders**: Certain neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, peripheral neuropathy, or nerve damage, can cause abnormal sensations, including buzzing or vibrating, in the anus or pelvic area.

Given the uncertainty of the diagnosis, the next diagnostic tests or evaluations a doctor might order include:

1. **Digital rectal examination (DRE)**: A DRE can help assess the tone and sensitivity of the anal sphincter and surrounding tissues.
2. **Anoscopy or sigmoidoscopy**: These procedures involve using a scope to visualize the inside of the anus and rectum to rule out any visible abnormalities, such as hemorrhoids, polyps, or inflammation.
3. **Electromyography (EMG)**: An EMG can help assess the electrical activity of the muscles in the pelvic floor, including the anal sphincter, to identify any abnormalities.
4. **Nerve conduction studies**: These tests can help assess the function of the nerves in the pelvic area, including the pudendal nerve, to identify any damage or irritation.
5. **MRI or CT scan of the lumbar spine**: Given the history of back problems, imaging studies of the lumbar spine may help identify any underlying conditions, such as nerve compression or disc herniation, that could be contributing to the symptoms.

A colon specialist, also known as a gastroenterologist or colorectal surgeon, may be a good next step in the diagnostic process. They can provide a more detailed evaluation of the anus, rectum, and colon, and may be able to identify any underlying conditions that are contributing to the symptoms.

It is essential to find a doctor who is willing to listen and work with you to diagnose and treat the condition. Consider seeking a second opinion or consulting with a specialist, such as a gastroenterologist, colorectal surgeon, or pain management specialist, who may have more experience with unusual or complex conditions."
"Might be constipated, but have still been able to go #2.","I've been constipated before, so I know what it feels like, but I just feel really weird this time. Ever since I had my daughter almost a year ago, I have never been so constipated all the time. Something definitely got messed up at some point in there because it's never been the same pre baby. 

So I've taken milk of magnesia and it usually helps within the day, sometimes (rarely) the next morning and I never take more than 2-4 tbsp the entire day. I haven't in probably over a month because I've been taking a colon cleanse pill to help keep me regular and boy has it. I've never been more grateful for an easy bowel movement..but probably for the last week or so, I feel so stopped up. I had 2-3 BM's the other day, but very little each time. I had a slightly better one this morning and at least 1 small one every other day. This isn't normal for me, and it's lasted longer than normal so I'm a little worried. 

I still have the colon cleanse pills (took one this morning), milk of mag., and I have a do-it-yourself enema in case I just *can't*. My stomach feels super nauseous often, and anymore I just don't feel good. I know I'm not getting sick as far as anything that's been going around. I'm a generally healthy person and I'm even up to date with vaccines as well as my daughter. I've even tried to eat a big meal and usually soon after it helps push it out, but it just sits there now.

No previous medical issues and no medications, but am taking a colon cleanse pill, garcinia cambogia, and benadryl (sometimes). The others are every morning.",7,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be considered include:

1. **Postpartum Constipation**: The patient's constipation started after giving birth, which could be related to hormonal changes, pelvic floor muscle weakness, or other postpartum factors.
2. **Gastrointestinal Motility Disorder**: The patient's symptoms of persistent constipation, nausea, and abdominal discomfort could be indicative of a motility disorder, such as slow gut motility or gastroparesis.
3. **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)**: The patient's symptoms of constipation, abdominal pain, and nausea could be consistent with IBS, especially given the absence of other alarming symptoms.
4. **Hormonal Imbalance**: The patient's symptoms could be related to hormonal changes, particularly given the onset of symptoms after childbirth.
5. **Obstruction or Blockage**: Although less likely, the patient's symptoms of persistent constipation and abdominal pain could be indicative of a mechanical obstruction or blockage in the intestines.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: To rule out any underlying infections or inflammatory conditions that could be contributing to the patient's symptoms.
2. **Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)**: To evaluate the patient's electrolyte levels, liver function, and kidney function, which could be affected by the patient's symptoms or underlying conditions.
3. **Thyroid Function Tests**: To evaluate the patient's thyroid hormone levels, as hypothyroidism can cause constipation and other gastrointestinal symptoms.
4. **Pelvic Exam**: To assess the patient's pelvic floor muscle strength and rule out any pelvic floor disorders that could be contributing to the patient's symptoms.
5. **Abdominal X-ray or Computed Tomography (CT) Scan**: To rule out any mechanical obstruction or blockage in the intestines and evaluate the patient's abdominal anatomy.
6. **Anorectal Manometry**: To assess the patient's anal sphincter function and rectal sensation, which could be affected by the patient's symptoms or underlying conditions.
7. **Colonoscopy**: To rule out any colon cancer or other colon pathology that could be contributing to the patient's symptoms, although this is less likely given the patient's age and lack of other alarming symptoms.
8. **Hormone Level Tests**: To evaluate the patient's hormone levels, particularly progesterone and estrogen, which could be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

Justifications for each recommendation:

* The patient's symptoms of persistent constipation, nausea, and abdominal discomfort warrant a comprehensive evaluation to rule out any underlying conditions that could be contributing to these symptoms.
* The patient's postpartum status and lack of previous medical issues suggest that hormonal changes or postpartum factors could be contributing to the patient's symptoms.
* The patient's use of colon cleanse pills, garcinia cambogia, and benadryl could be affecting the patient's gastrointestinal motility or hormone levels, and these medications should be considered when interpreting the patient's symptoms and diagnostic test results.
* The patient's weight and body mass index (BMI) could be contributing to the patient's symptoms, and a weight loss plan should be considered as part of the patient's treatment plan.

It is essential to note that these recommendations are based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, and a thorough physical examination and medical history should be performed to determine the best course of evaluation and treatment."
"Abdominal pain, tenderness after night of excruciating pain.","Hi there - I have admittedly been under a lot of stress lately, but this illness isn't helping at all. Oh:

26, female, 5'2 and 115 lbs, white, Southern California. Recently had a cervical biopsy, it came back negative, don't know if that's relevant (3 weeks ago maybe).

Firstly, last night I had  a night of EXCRUCIATING stomach and lower-back cramping. It felt like my period, but that had just ended. It was really bad.

Today, I am sore all over, but specifically in the abdomen. My right side feels sore when I walk, and the middle bit is tender when I breathe deeply. My instincts tell me that I had some sort of gastrointestinal distress, and the cramping was so intense that it's actually left all of my muscles sore.

Oh, and for the record, I have been completely constipated this whole time. It felt like I was going to have diarrhea, but nothing has happened. This morning I felt VERY nauseated, but didn't vomit. I have some chills, but no fever. I am VERY fatigued, but that could be from work/life.

I'm just wondering if this is some crazy stomach flu, and whether I need to go to urgent care (no insurance, so it's a big decision).

Thanks for any help!

Edit: Just wanted to add that I'm keeping extremely hydrated.",7,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be considered include:

1. **Gastroenteritis**: The symptoms of stomach cramping, nausea, and constipation suggest a gastrointestinal infection, which could be viral or bacterial in nature.
2. **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)**: The abdominal pain, constipation, and nausea could be indicative of IBS, especially given the recent stress.
3. **Ovarian Cyst or Torsion**: The severe lower-back cramping and abdominal tenderness, particularly on the right side, could be related to an ovarian cyst or torsion, although this is less likely given the recent negative cervical biopsy.
4. **Appendicitis**: The abdominal tenderness, nausea, and constipation could be indicative of appendicitis, although the lack of fever and vomiting makes this less likely.
5. **Stress-induced gastrointestinal distress**: The recent stress and constipation could be contributing to the gastrointestinal symptoms.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: To rule out infection or inflammation, a CBC can help identify any abnormalities in white blood cell count.
2. **Urinalysis**: To check for any urinary tract infections or kidney stones that could be causing the abdominal pain and discomfort.
3. **Abdominal Ultrasound**: To evaluate the ovaries, appendix, and other abdominal organs for any abnormalities, such as cysts or inflammation.
4. **Stool Test**: To check for any gastrointestinal infections, such as bacterial or viral infections.
5. **Physical Examination**: A thorough physical examination, including a pelvic exam, to evaluate the abdominal tenderness and check for any masses or abnormalities.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* The symptoms of stomach cramping, nausea, and constipation suggest a gastrointestinal issue, and the diagnostic tests listed can help identify the underlying cause.
* The recent cervical biopsy and negative result make it less likely that the symptoms are related to a gynecological issue, but an abdominal ultrasound can still help evaluate the ovaries and other abdominal organs.
* The lack of fever and vomiting makes appendicitis less likely, but an abdominal ultrasound and physical examination can still help evaluate this possibility.
* The recent stress and constipation could be contributing to the gastrointestinal symptoms, and a stool test and physical examination can help identify any underlying issues.

Given the severity of the symptoms and the lack of insurance, it may be wise to visit an urgent care center to rule out any serious underlying conditions. However, if the symptoms improve with hydration and rest, it may be possible to manage the condition with over-the-counter medications and lifestyle changes."
My wife's weird symptoms.,"I can't even begin to get into this with just a title, but it's midnight where I'm at, it's memorial day weekend, and our local ER is a complete and total joke......anyways. 

My wife is 25, has an under active thyroid which she takes medicine for, as well as panic attacks, anxiety, and depression which she takes medication for. None of her medications, or dosings have changed in more than a year.

Anyway it started yesterday, my wife was napping on the couch when a family member came and got me because she had crawled in the floor. I arrived and honestly thought it was some kind of sleep walking, and laughed it off until she started throwing punches. Once I finally got her eyes open she acted confused, but I eventually got her back to the couch. Her head flopped over onto my shoulder and she was out like a light instantly. I went back to thinking it was just a sleep walking thing when she slid in the floor and starting thrashing. I immediately thought seizure and told my family to call 911. She's never had seizures before. 

After her first bout of shaking she woke up and held my hand....they she said she could feel another attack coming on and went stiff....after that was over I told her to concentrate on me...and when she felt another coming I would talk to her and she could fight it off...I could actually feel her tensing and Untensing as she stopped the shaking fits. 

The ambulance arrived.....at this point she was tired and could barely walk, but once we arrived at the hospital she was fine again. They ran tests and found nothing, the ER Doc barely spoke english, only examined her for about 10 seconds then said no seizure and left. A med student came in....I told him the story...he shrugged and left.....and then they discharged her. She felt tired, but fine all today and most of today...

Now this evening. 

She was fine and we decided to see a movie, halfway up the steps in the theater she said she was was getting tired...and made a joke that she was out of shape. By the time she got to her seat she was completely out of breath and falling asleep. I got her back to the car and she didn't want to go back to the ER because they wouldn't do anything anyway, so we came home and she went to sleep. After about four hours sleep she woke up and came downstairs to where I was sitting...she was once again out of breath and tired just from the walk, but otherwise felt fine. 

She just went back to bed saying she'd sleep it off. 

I'm at a loss here.......with it being memorial day weekend any reputable doctor within driving distance is out of the office, and all our local ER ever does is shrug and send people home. (My father is older and in failing health....we have a lot of experience there.) 

I know this is a wall of text...and thank you to anyone who read it, but I have no idea how to help or where to get it....any suggestions would be awesome. 

",7,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be considered include:

1. **Seizure disorder**: The episodes of shaking, thrashing, and loss of consciousness, followed by confusion and fatigue, are consistent with seizure activity. The fact that the ER doctor did not observe any seizure activity does not rule out the possibility of a seizure disorder.
2. **Cardiac arrhythmia**: The episodes of shortness of breath, fatigue, and near-syncope (feeling like she's going to pass out) could be related to an underlying cardiac arrhythmia, such as atrial fibrillation or supraventricular tachycardia.
3. **Anxiety or panic disorder exacerbation**: The wife's history of anxiety and panic attacks could be contributing to her symptoms, particularly the shortness of breath and fatigue.
4. **Hypothyroidism exacerbation**: Although the wife's thyroid medication has not changed, it's possible that her hypothyroidism is not well-controlled, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and other symptoms.
5. **Sleep disorder**: The wife's history of sleep walking and the fact that she was able to ""fight off"" the shaking episodes by concentrating on her husband suggest that a sleep disorder, such as narcolepsy or sleep apnea, could be contributing to her symptoms.
6. **Mitochondrial myopathy**: This is a rare condition that affects the muscles and can cause episodes of weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
7. **Adrenal insufficiency**: This is a condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough cortisol, leading to fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Electroencephalogram (EEG)**: To evaluate for seizure activity and rule out a seizure disorder.
2. **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: To evaluate for cardiac arrhythmias and rule out any underlying cardiac conditions.
3. **Holter monitor**: A 24-hour ECG monitoring test to evaluate for cardiac arrhythmias.
4. **Thyroid function tests**: To evaluate the wife's thyroid hormone levels and ensure that her hypothyroidism is well-controlled.
5. **Sleep study**: To evaluate for sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea or narcolepsy.
6. **Blood tests**: To rule out any underlying metabolic or hormonal disorders, such as adrenal insufficiency.
7. **Cardiac stress test**: To evaluate the wife's cardiac function and rule out any underlying cardiac conditions.
8. **Neurological examination**: A thorough neurological examination to evaluate for any underlying neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis or peripheral neuropathy.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* The wife's symptoms are complex and multifaceted, suggesting that a comprehensive evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying cause.
* The ER doctor's brief examination and dismissal of the wife's symptoms without further evaluation are concerning, and a more thorough evaluation is necessary to ensure that the wife receives appropriate care.
* The wife's history of hypothyroidism, anxiety, and panic attacks suggests that these conditions may be contributing to her symptoms, and further evaluation is necessary to determine the extent to which these conditions are contributing to her symptoms.
* The wife's symptoms are intermittent and unpredictable, suggesting that a diagnostic test or evaluation that can capture these episodes, such as an EEG or Holter monitor, may be necessary to determine the underlying cause."
Imperforate Anus - Can I give birth naturally?,"Hi,

I was born with an imperforate anus. I was fortunate my case was relatively minor - I was born with my anus further forward and tighter than usual (not opening up into my vagina or absent altogether as can happen). Doctors and my parents didn’t notice that there was anything wrong with me until I began eating solid foods around 6 months old. Once diagnosed, I had two surgeries and a few other procedures to… widen it…? Grim times. Whatever. I’ve been able to poop normally ever since (woohoo!) but it is of course still a bit further forward than usual. It’s pretty much right behind my vagina.

I was wondering if anyone knows whether I can expect to give birth naturally or not? I've tried to find out on the internet but there's only really information about babies being born with it and nothing about later life.

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you!",7,"Based on the symptoms and medical history provided, possible medical conditions to consider include:

1. **Imperforate anus with rectovaginal fistula or other anorectal malformations**: Although the individual had surgery to correct the imperforate anus, there may be residual effects or complications that could impact childbirth.
2. **Anorectal dysfunction or chronic constipation**: The individual's history of surgical procedures to widen the anus may lead to ongoing anorectal dysfunction or chronic constipation, which could affect bowel movements during pregnancy and childbirth.
3. **Pelvic floor dysfunction**: The abnormal anatomy and surgical history may increase the risk of pelvic floor dysfunction, which could impact urinary and bowel continence during pregnancy and childbirth.

To evaluate the individual's suitability for natural childbirth, the following diagnostic tests or evaluations may be recommended:

1. **Pelvic MRI or ultrasound**: To assess the anatomy of the pelvis, vagina, and anus, and to evaluate for any potential complications or abnormalities that could impact childbirth.
2. **Anorectal manometry**: To assess the function of the anal sphincter and rectum, and to evaluate for any anorectal dysfunction that could affect bowel movements during pregnancy and childbirth.
3. **Colorectal surgery consultation**: To discuss the individual's surgical history and to evaluate the potential risks and benefits of natural childbirth, considering the previous surgeries and anorectal malformation.
4. **Obstetric consultation**: To discuss the individual's pregnancy and childbirth options, and to evaluate the potential risks and benefits of natural childbirth, considering the anorectal malformation and surgical history.
5. **Urogynecology consultation**: To assess the individual's pelvic floor function and to evaluate for any potential complications or abnormalities that could impact urinary and bowel continence during pregnancy and childbirth.

These evaluations will help determine the individual's suitability for natural childbirth and identify any potential complications or risks that need to be addressed. A multidisciplinary team of healthcare providers, including colorectal surgeons, obstetricians, and urogynecologists, may be involved in the evaluation and management of the individual's care."
"Black mole appeared last night, bleeding under skin","So yesterday evening I noticed a very dark brown/ black spot on my lower left abdomen that was a bit raised. I hadn't ever seen it before, even earlier that day. I assumed maybe it was a blood blister and gave it a small pinch and squeeze, not rough or anything. And then i got all of these little red dots around the area as if a blood vessel had broken or something. I gave my self a small pinch a bit next to it and the same thing happened. I can pinch myself anywhere else and that does not happen.
The freckle is also tender to the touch. I have stopped pinching it, but I really didn't even mess with it much and now this morning it looks the same. I looked up pictures of cancerous moles and freckles and they don't look like what I have.
http://imgur.com/pdsYd4R This picture is from today, so the redness isn't just from my initial pinching.



I am 20, F, 132lbs, 5ft5, white/ middle eastern, just popped up, I am in philly, I have had some small amount of abdominal swelling on the opposite side for a month (no one can figure out what is causing it) and some petechiae appearing on my abdomen, chest, and arms for the past week. In addition my urine has been smelling very very strong. I am taking vyvanse for adhd, alpha lipoic acid, and vitamin D supplements because i got a blood test and my levels were apparently really low.



Seems relevant to add. I did get blood tests done about three weeks ago because of the abdominal swelling and there wasn't anything that they saw (aside from low vit D) that worried them.",7,"Based on the symptoms described, here are some possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible medical conditions:

1. **Malignant melanoma**: Although the patient has looked up pictures of cancerous moles and freckles and doesn't think it matches, it's still essential to rule out this possibility due to the sudden appearance of a dark, raised spot.
2. **Hematoma or blood blister**: The patient's initial assumption of a blood blister could be correct, especially given the appearance of red dots around the area after pinching.
3. **Vasculitis**: The presence of petechiae (small red or purple spots) on the abdomen, chest, and arms, along with the tender, dark spot, could indicate an inflammatory condition affecting blood vessels.
4. **Thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy**: The easy bruising and appearance of petechiae may suggest a problem with blood clotting or platelet count.
5. **Infection or abscess**: The tenderness and redness around the spot could indicate an infectious process.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Dermatological examination**: A thorough examination by a dermatologist to assess the spot and surrounding skin, including a review of the patient's medical history and any previous skin conditions.
2. **Biopsy**: A biopsy of the dark spot to rule out malignant melanoma or other skin cancers.
3. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: To evaluate platelet count, white blood cell count, and red blood cell count, which could help identify any underlying hematological conditions.
4. **Coagulation studies**: To assess the patient's blood clotting function, including prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT).
5. **Urinalysis**: To investigate the cause of the strong-smelling urine, which could be related to an underlying infection, kidney issue, or other condition.
6. **Abdominal imaging**: To further evaluate the abdominal swelling on the opposite side, which could be related to an underlying condition such as a cyst, tumor, or inflammatory process.
7. **Vitamin and mineral panel**: To reassess the patient's vitamin D levels and evaluate other essential vitamins and minerals, as the patient is already taking supplements.
8. **Infectious disease workup**: To rule out any underlying infections that could be contributing to the patient's symptoms, such as a blood culture or serological tests.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* The sudden appearance of a dark, raised spot warrants further investigation to rule out malignant melanoma or other skin cancers.
* The presence of petechiae and easy bruising suggests a possible hematological condition, which can be evaluated through CBC and coagulation studies.
* The strong-smelling urine and abdominal swelling on the opposite side require further investigation to identify any underlying conditions.
* The patient's use of Vyvanse and supplements, as well as their low vitamin D levels, should be considered in the diagnostic evaluation to rule out any potential interactions or underlying conditions.

It is essential to consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation and to determine the best course of action."
I'm 99% sure my girlfriend has a concussion.....,I am 99% sure my girlfriend has a concussion and she is having trouble remember things like she doesn't even remember who I am what should I do? Is it temporary?  If it is how long should it last?  If it's permanent is there anything I can do to bring a little bit of her memory back? Please answer quickly this is a bit urgent.,7,"Given the symptoms you've described, it's crucial to seek immediate medical attention for your girlfriend. Possible medical conditions include:

1. **Concussion or Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)**: Given your suspicion of a concussion, this is a primary concern. Memory issues, including not recognizing familiar people, can be symptoms of a concussion.
2. **Post-Traumatic Amnesia (PTA)**: This condition often follows a TBI and can cause memory loss, confusion, and difficulty recognizing people and places.
3. **Other neurological conditions**: Though less likely, other conditions such as encephalitis, meningitis, or a stroke could also cause these symptoms, especially if the onset was sudden.

Recommended next steps and diagnostic tests:

1. **Immediate Medical Evaluation**: Take your girlfriend to the emergency room or urgent care. A healthcare professional needs to assess her condition promptly.
2. **CT or MRI Scan**: These imaging tests can help identify any structural damage to the brain, such as bleeding or swelling, which could be causing her symptoms.
3. **Neurological Examination**: A thorough neurological exam will assess her cognitive function, including memory, and other neurological signs.
4. **Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)**: This assessment tool helps evaluate the severity of a brain injury by checking eye, verbal, and motor responses.
5. **Memory and Cognitive Tests**: Once her condition is stabilized, specific tests like the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) or the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) can help evaluate the extent of her memory and cognitive impairments.

Regarding the duration and potential for recovery:

- **Temporary vs. Permanent**: The impact of a concussion or TBI on memory can vary widely among individuals. Some people recover fully within days to weeks, while others may experience persistent symptoms.
- **Duration**: If the cause is a concussion, most people see significant improvement within 7-10 days, but full recovery can take up to 3 months or, in some cases, longer.
- **Recovery of Memory**: Rehabilitation with a focus on cognitive therapy, including memory exercises and strategies to compensate for memory loss, can be helpful. Early intervention by a neurologist, psychologist, or a rehabilitation specialist is key.

It's essential to follow the guidance of healthcare professionals for the best outcomes. They can provide personalized advice and treatment plans tailored to your girlfriend's specific condition and needs."
At what point should I go to a ER with chest discomfort?,"I'm 19 year old female who was diagnosed with asthma less than a year ago. It seems to be mostly brought out with some seasonal allergies. I don't know what I'm allergic too yet, nor do I have a planned allergy test. I am on flovent discus to help control it, two puffs, twice a day. It works fairly well, as last summer I was totally out, passed out from asthma. And  so far this year, with taking allergy medication and my flovent, I still get this terrible chest pressure/discomfort that goes&amp;comes away. Taking an emergency inhaler helps, but I don't want to become dependent on it. At which point should I just go into the emergency room and get them to help me with this?

also, fairly sure this is irrelevant to this case but I'm average height and on the lower end of average weight.",7,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be contributing to the chest pressure/discomfort include:

1. **Uncontrolled asthma**: Despite being on Flovent Discus, the persistent chest pressure/discomfort suggests that the asthma may not be fully controlled.
2. **Allergic rhinitis**: The seasonal allergies and lack of allergy testing may be contributing to the symptoms.
3. **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**: Chest pressure/discomfort can be a symptom of GERD, especially if it worsens after eating or at night.
4. **Anxiety or panic disorder**: The chest pressure/discomfort may be exacerbated by anxiety or panic, especially if the symptoms are intermittent and worsen with stress.

Recommended next diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Allergy testing**: To identify specific allergens that may be triggering the asthma and allergic rhinitis symptoms.
2. **Spirometry**: To assess lung function and determine if the asthma is well-controlled.
3. **Chest X-ray**: To rule out other potential causes of chest pressure/discomfort, such as pneumonia or pulmonary embolism.
4. **Esophageal pH monitoring**: To evaluate for GERD, especially if symptoms worsen after eating or at night.
5. **Psychological evaluation**: To assess for anxiety or panic disorder, which may be contributing to the symptoms.

When to go to the emergency room:

1. **Severe difficulty breathing**: If the chest pressure/discomfort is accompanied by severe difficulty breathing, wheezing, or coughing.
2. **Chest pain or tightness**: If the chest pressure/discomfort is severe, persistent, or radiates to the arms, back, or jaw.
3. **Fainting or near-fainting**: If the symptoms cause fainting or near-fainting, as experienced last summer.
4. **Increased emergency inhaler use**: If the frequency of emergency inhaler use increases, or if the symptoms worsen despite using the inhaler.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* Allergy testing is essential to identify specific allergens and develop a targeted treatment plan.
* Spirometry and chest X-ray can help assess lung function and rule out other potential causes of chest pressure/discomfort.
* Esophageal pH monitoring can evaluate for GERD, which may be contributing to the symptoms.
* Psychological evaluation can help identify anxiety or panic disorder, which may be exacerbating the symptoms.
* Emergency room evaluation is necessary if the symptoms are severe, persistent, or worsening, as they may indicate a life-threatening condition.

Note: The patient's height and weight are not directly relevant to the symptoms, but it's essential to consider overall health and medical history when evaluating the symptoms."
Blood clots in my leg? (red streaks on inner thighs),When I was taking a shower I started rubbing my legs extra hard and noticed my leg hair falling out. Then my heart rate went way the fuck up and both my inner thighs has this red  artery I could see it was like an artery it was branching too. I jumped out the shower and laid down on my chest and took like 3 ibuprofens. Before hand I had taken more adderall than I have before so I was thinking maybe I had a panic attack and plus I didn't want to go to the doctor and get in trouble and it turn out just to be a panic attack. Also I notice sometimes if I walk to the store my legs feel numb or sometimes itchy.,7,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be considered include:

1. **Vasculitis or Vasospasm**: The visible, branching red artery on the inner thighs could indicate inflammation or spasm of the blood vessels, which may be related to the increased heart rate and other symptoms.
2. **Panic Attack or Anxiety Disorder**: The rapid heart rate, especially after taking more Adderall than usual, could be indicative of a panic attack. However, the physical symptoms such as leg hair falling out and visible red arteries may suggest an underlying medical condition rather than just a panic attack.
3. **Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD)**: The numbness or itchiness in the legs when walking could be a sign of reduced blood flow to the legs, which is a characteristic symptom of PAD.
4. **Neurological Disorder**: The numbness or itchiness in the legs could also be related to a neurological condition, such as peripheral neuropathy or a nerve compression syndrome.
5. **Hypertension or Cardiovascular Disease**: The increased heart rate and visible red arteries may indicate high blood pressure or an underlying cardiovascular condition.

To further evaluate these symptoms, a doctor might order the following diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG)**: To assess heart rhythm and detect any potential cardiac abnormalities.
2. **Blood Pressure Monitoring**: To evaluate blood pressure and detect any potential hypertension.
3. **Complete Blood Count (CBC) and Blood Chemistry Tests**: To rule out any underlying infections, inflammatory conditions, or other systemic diseases.
4. **Doppler Ultrasound or Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) Test**: To evaluate blood flow to the legs and detect any potential PAD or peripheral vascular disease.
5. **Neurological Examination**: To assess nerve function and detect any potential neurological disorders.
6. **Adderall Level and Toxicity Screening**: To evaluate the potential effects of excessive Adderall use on the body.
7. **Imaging Studies (e.g., CT or MRI Angiography)**: To visualize the blood vessels and detect any potential vasculitis, vasospasm, or other vascular abnormalities.

It is essential to consult a doctor to determine the underlying cause of these symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan. The doctor will likely perform a physical examination, take a detailed medical history, and order diagnostic tests to rule out potential conditions and determine the best course of action."
CT scan revealed Meningioma,"for all the sidebar info: I am a 21 white female who is 5'2"" 145lbs living in california with a tiny brain issue. 

 A few months ago, i began getting these really severe headaches. I normally do not get headaches or migraines and these just seem off to me. They are very sharp, come completely randomly and last only seconds. Sometimes there is a faint ache for a few minutes afterwards. I have dropped things before because it is so sudden and painful. 

Anywho, i felt that it was strange so i went to my doctor, who didnt seem to concerned with it, but ordered a CT scan anyways because she said it was pretty simple and covered by my insurance completely. 
Today the results said that there was a 9mm , what they think is, meningioma. She told me that it is a benign tumor and not a big deal because it was so small and wasnt causing symptoms.  She ordered an MRI to confirm that that is indeed a meningioma tumor. 

I understand that it is tiny, but i guess i am a bit confused as to why she doesnt feel like the headaches are serious symptoms. Is this something that would be discussed with me more in detail by the specialist when i go to get the MRI? Is it just assumed that its not going to need to be removed because it is so small? She said to monitor it, what if it gets a tiny bit bigger? then does it need to get removed?

I know. these are things i should have asked her. I was just kind of in a really weird daze after she told me. Like i was expecting her to tell me im crazy and theres nothing wrong with my brain. Yet there it is. this tiny little thing that is about 9mm larger than i think it should be. ",7,"Based on the symptoms and initial diagnosis, possible medical conditions that may be considered include:

1. **Meningioma**: A benign tumor that arises from the meninges, the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. The 9mm tumor size and location will be further evaluated with an MRI.
2. **Other types of brain tumors**: Although less likely, other types of brain tumors, such as gliomas or schwannomas, may be considered if the MRI results are inconclusive or if additional symptoms develop.
3. **Vascular malformations**: Abnormalities in blood vessels, such as arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) or cavernous malformations, may cause sudden, severe headaches.
4. **Migraines or other headache disorders**: Although the patient reports that the headaches are unusual for her, it's possible that she may be experiencing a migraine or other headache disorder that's unrelated to the meningioma.

Recommended next diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **MRI (already ordered)**: To confirm the diagnosis of meningioma and evaluate the tumor's size, location, and potential impact on surrounding brain tissue.
2. **Neurological examination**: A thorough examination by a neurologist or neurosurgeon to assess the patient's cognitive function, motor skills, and sensory perception.
3. **Consultation with a neurosurgeon or neuro-oncologist**: To discuss the diagnosis, treatment options, and potential risks and benefits of surgery or monitoring.
4. **Follow-up imaging studies**: Regular MRI or CT scans to monitor the tumor's size and growth, as well as to assess for any changes in surrounding brain tissue.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* The MRI will provide more detailed information about the tumor's size, location, and potential impact on surrounding brain tissue.
* A neurological examination will help assess the patient's overall brain function and identify any potential deficits.
* Consultation with a specialist will provide the patient with a more detailed understanding of the diagnosis, treatment options, and potential risks and benefits.
* Follow-up imaging studies will allow for monitoring of the tumor's growth and assessment of any changes in surrounding brain tissue, which will inform treatment decisions.

Regarding the patient's concerns:

* The doctor's initial assessment that the headaches are not serious symptoms may be revisited during the consultation with a specialist, who can provide a more detailed evaluation of the patient's symptoms and their potential relationship to the meningioma.
* The decision to monitor the tumor rather than removing it immediately may be based on the tumor's small size and benign nature. However, the patient should discuss the potential risks and benefits of surgery with a specialist, including the possibility of removing the tumor if it grows or causes symptoms.
* The patient's questions about what happens if the tumor grows or causes symptoms should be addressed during the consultation with a specialist, who can provide guidance on treatment options and potential outcomes."
Which doctors deal with issues like body heat?,"I apologize if this is the wrong subreddit and also for my general english. Tried to google but all the answers are either blogs or too vague. Her height is around 4'11 and weight is 93kg's or 200 pounds.

My mom is 54 and has high blood pressure and just can't tolerate a bit of heat. Her office is literally has like 10 ac's in a big room and even in the office despite the ac's she uses 2 table fans, and i am afraid she has gotten used to it since the past 20 years. She sleeps in a room with a A/C and 3 table fans but still has problems and constantly complains about heat. Every one else in family can sleep in peace with a single fan. 

She is also a cancer survivor and can't lose weight. She exercises and walks more than our family combined. 

Which doctor do i take her to? Our general doctor recently died so i am kinda confused.",7,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be contributing to your mom's intolerance to heat and inability to lose weight despite regular exercise include:

1. **Hypothyroidism**: This condition, where the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough hormones, can cause heat intolerance, weight gain, and fatigue.
2. **Menopause**: As your mom is 54, she may be experiencing menopausal symptoms, including hot flashes and weight gain.
3. **Medication side effects**: Certain medications, such as those used to treat high blood pressure, can cause heat intolerance as a side effect.
4. **Sleep apnea**: This condition, which can cause disrupted sleep patterns, may be contributing to your mom's heat intolerance and weight gain.
5. **Lymphedema or other circulatory issues**: As a cancer survivor, your mom may be experiencing circulatory issues that could be contributing to her heat intolerance.
6. **Cushing's syndrome**: This rare endocrine disorder can cause weight gain, heat intolerance, and high blood pressure.
7. **Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)**: Although less common in postmenopausal women, PCOS can cause weight gain, heat intolerance, and hormonal imbalances.

To further evaluate your mom's symptoms, the following diagnostic tests or evaluations may be recommended:

1. **Complete blood count (CBC) and metabolic panel**: To rule out underlying conditions such as anemia, diabetes, or thyroid disorders.
2. **Thyroid function tests (TFTs)**: To evaluate thyroid hormone levels and rule out hypothyroidism.
3. **Sleep study**: To assess for sleep apnea or other sleep disorders.
4. **Echocardiogram or vascular studies**: To evaluate circulatory function and rule out lymphedema or other circulatory issues.
5. **Hormone level tests**: To assess for hormonal imbalances, such as those seen in menopause, PCOS, or Cushing's syndrome.
6. **Medication review**: To evaluate potential side effects of medications and adjust as needed.

As for which doctor to consult, consider the following options:

1. **Primary care physician (PCP)**: A new PCP can provide a comprehensive evaluation and refer your mom to specialists if needed.
2. **Endocrinologist**: If thyroid disorders or hormonal imbalances are suspected, an endocrinologist can provide specialized care.
3. **Cardiologist**: If circulatory issues or sleep apnea are suspected, a cardiologist can evaluate and manage these conditions.
4. **Oncologist**: As a cancer survivor, your mom may still be under the care of an oncologist, who can evaluate potential late effects of cancer treatment.

It's essential to find a new primary care physician who can provide a thorough evaluation and refer your mom to specialists if needed. You can ask for recommendations from friends, family, or other healthcare professionals to find a suitable doctor."
(NSFW) painful bump on scrotum,"For a long while, I've had 2 hard white bumps on my scrotum that only hurt after messing with then awhile. It would be similar to a pimple like pain.  I've had these for at least 4-5 months. 

Last week, the other one (not pictured) hurt when it was touched. I can't find it now, so maybe it went away. 

Today, this one hurts. I wasn't messing with it.

",7,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be considered include:

1. **Epidermoid cysts**: These are benign cysts that can form on the scrotum, often appearing as hard, white bumps. They can become painful if irritated or inflamed.
2. **Sebaceous cysts**: Similar to epidermoid cysts, sebaceous cysts are benign growths that can form on the scrotum, causing pain and discomfort if irritated.
3. **Folliculitis**: This is an inflammation of the hair follicles, which can cause painful bumps or pimples on the scrotum.
4. **Ingrown hair**: An ingrown hair can cause a painful bump or pimple, especially if it becomes infected.
5. **Scrotal calcinosis**: This is a rare condition characterized by the formation of small, hard calcium deposits on the scrotum, which can cause pain and discomfort.

To further evaluate these symptoms, a doctor might order the following diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Physical examination**: A thorough physical examination of the scrotum and surrounding area to assess the size, shape, and tenderness of the bumps.
2. **Ultrasound**: An ultrasound scan may be ordered to evaluate the internal structure of the bumps and determine if they are cysts or other types of growths.
3. **Biopsy**: If the bumps are suspicious or do not respond to treatment, a biopsy may be ordered to rule out any underlying conditions such as cancer.
4. **Complete blood count (CBC)**: A CBC may be ordered to check for any signs of infection or inflammation.
5. **Swab culture**: If the bumps appear to be infected, a swab culture may be ordered to identify the underlying cause of the infection.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* A physical examination is necessary to assess the size, shape, and tenderness of the bumps and to determine if they are causing any other symptoms.
* An ultrasound scan can help to evaluate the internal structure of the bumps and determine if they are cysts or other types of growths.
* A biopsy may be necessary to rule out any underlying conditions such as cancer, especially if the bumps are suspicious or do not respond to treatment.
* A CBC may be ordered to check for any signs of infection or inflammation, which can help to guide treatment.
* A swab culture may be ordered to identify the underlying cause of the infection, if the bumps appear to be infected.

It's essential to consult a doctor for a proper evaluation and diagnosis, as they can assess the symptoms and provide a personalized treatment plan."

Protruding stomach - fat vs posture?,"I am wondering how it is possible to tell whether my stomach is due to weight gain in the belly or simply a bad posture or something else. I am skinny in all other parts of the body but my stomach always sticks out. I can't grab very much fat in that area which made me consider posture issues or some other condition.

19 / M / 6'1 / 187lbs ",7,"Based on your symptoms, here are some possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible Medical Conditions:

1. **Visceral Fat Accumulation**: Despite being skinny in other areas, you may have a high amount of visceral fat (fat around the organs) in your abdominal cavity, which can cause your stomach to protrude.
2. **Diastasis Recti**: A condition where the abdominal muscles separate, causing the stomach to bulge outward.
3. **Hernia**: A hernia in the abdominal wall can cause a bulge or protrusion in the stomach area.
4. **Gastrointestinal Issues**: Conditions like gastroparesis, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can cause bloating, discomfort, and a protruding stomach.
5. **Posture-Related Issues**: As you mentioned, poor posture can contribute to a protruding stomach, especially if you have a lordotic (inwardly curved) lower back or a weak core.
6. **Hormonal Imbalance**: Certain hormonal imbalances, such as Cushing's syndrome or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), can cause weight gain and fat accumulation in the abdominal area.
7. **Muscle Imbalance**: Weak or tight abdominal muscles can contribute to a protruding stomach.

Recommended Diagnostic Tests or Evaluations:

1. **Physical Examination**: A doctor will perform a thorough physical examination to assess your posture, abdominal muscle strength, and check for any visible signs of hernias or other abnormalities.
2. **Body Fat Percentage Measurement**: A body fat percentage measurement can help determine if you have a high amount of visceral fat.
3. **Abdominal Ultrasound**: An ultrasound can help identify any potential hernias, diastasis recti, or other abdominal abnormalities.
4. **X-rays or CT Scan**: Imaging tests like X-rays or CT scans can help rule out any underlying conditions, such as a hernia or gastrointestinal issues.
5. **Posture Assessment**: A doctor or physical therapist can assess your posture and provide guidance on exercises to improve your core strength and posture.
6. **Blood Tests**: Blood tests can help rule out hormonal imbalances or other underlying conditions that may be contributing to your symptoms.
7. **Nutrition and Lifestyle Assessment**: A doctor or registered dietitian can assess your diet and lifestyle habits to identify any potential contributing factors to your symptoms.

Justifications:

* A physical examination and body fat percentage measurement can help determine if your stomach protrusion is due to excess fat or other factors.
* Imaging tests like abdominal ultrasound, X-rays, or CT scans can help identify any underlying conditions that may be contributing to your symptoms.
* Posture assessment and exercises can help improve your core strength and posture, which may help reduce the appearance of a protruding stomach.
* Blood tests can help rule out hormonal imbalances or other underlying conditions that may be contributing to your symptoms.
* A nutrition and lifestyle assessment can help identify any potential contributing factors to your symptoms, such as a poor diet or sedentary lifestyle.

It's essential to consult with a doctor to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms and develop a personalized plan to address them."

"Heart palpitations, tightest/slight pain in chest, shortness of breath, constant feeling of pressure?","About a month ago, I experienced a serious of heart palpitations. I was at work, not doing anything physically demanding, and then I was struck with palpitations. I've dealt with palpitations, that usually go away within 10-20 seconds, but this time it was different. 

The palpitations struck, and we're consistent for at least a minute or so. I panicked, and was close to telling someone to call 911, but I got some water, and kept my breathing up, so eventually it stopped. But it left shook, and actually a little weak, and full of anxiety. 

Since then, I have had a tightness in my chest, sometimes a slight pain, and shortness of breath. I feel like it much harder to get full breaths, and also my nasal passages have been dry and plugged up much more than usual (may be allergies). I also experience random spurts of palpitations more frequently than I have before. I have stopped drinking caffeine since then, because it makes me really anxious. I used to be able to drink a lot of caffeine, and would be just fine. 

I work outside, doing construction and landscaping work, and I also lift weights 2-3 days a week. Usually when I lift weights and work, I'm fine, and don't have a serious issue. But times like today, I was at the gym, and my heart was beating really hard and fast, and afterwards I was left with anxiety, and my heart felt like it was skipping a beat every so often. I'm currently still trying to relax myself. 

I plan on calling to set up a doctors appointment tomorrow, but I wanted to know if this seems like it could be something wrong with my heart, or if it's just my anxiety worsening. It's all very stressful, and scary.

Caucasian.
This has been persisting for about a month, maybe a little over. And I'm not currently taking at medications, or using workout stimulants. ",7,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be contributing to these symptoms include:

1. **Arrhythmias** (e.g., atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia): The episodes of heart palpitations, especially the prolonged one that lasted for at least a minute, could be indicative of an arrhythmia.
2. **Anxiety disorder**: The symptoms of anxiety, panic, and worry about heart symptoms are consistent with an anxiety disorder, which could be contributing to or exacerbating the physical symptoms.
3. **Cardiac hypertrophy**: The fact that the palpitations occur during physical activity, such as weightlifting, and are accompanied by shortness of breath and chest tightness, could suggest cardiac hypertrophy (thickening of the heart muscle).
4. **Mitral valve prolapse**: The symptoms of palpitations, shortness of breath, and chest tightness could be related to mitral valve prolapse, a condition where the mitral valve does not close properly.
5. **Hyperthyroidism**: The symptoms of palpitations, anxiety, and shortness of breath could be indicative of hyperthyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland produces excess thyroid hormones.
6. **Dehydration or electrolyte imbalance**: The dry and plugged-up nasal passages, as well as the recent cessation of caffeine consumption, could suggest dehydration or an electrolyte imbalance, which could contribute to heart palpitations and other symptoms.

To further evaluate these symptoms, a doctor might order the following diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG)**: To assess the heart's electrical activity and detect any arrhythmias or other cardiac abnormalities.
2. **Echocardiogram**: To evaluate the structure and function of the heart, including the mitral valve and cardiac chambers.
3. **Stress test or exercise stress test**: To assess the heart's response to physical activity and detect any signs of cardiac ischemia or arrhythmias.
4. **Blood tests**: To check for hyperthyroidism (thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, and triiodothyronine levels), electrolyte imbalances (sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium levels), and other potential underlying conditions (e.g., anemia, infection).
5. **Holter monitor**: To continuously monitor the heart's electrical activity over a 24-hour period to detect any arrhythmias or other cardiac abnormalities.
6. **Chest X-ray**: To evaluate the lungs and heart for any signs of disease or abnormality.
7. **Pulmonary function tests**: To assess lung function and detect any signs of respiratory disease or abnormality.
8. **Anxiety and depression screening**: To evaluate the presence and severity of anxiety and depression symptoms, which could be contributing to or exacerbating the physical symptoms.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* The ECG and echocardiogram are essential for evaluating cardiac structure and function.
* The stress test or exercise stress test can help detect cardiac ischemia or arrhythmias that may be triggered by physical activity.
* Blood tests can help identify underlying conditions that may be contributing to the symptoms.
* The Holter monitor can provide continuous monitoring of the heart's electrical activity to detect any arrhythmias or other cardiac abnormalities.
* The chest X-ray and pulmonary function tests can help evaluate lung function and detect any signs of respiratory disease or abnormality.
* Anxiety and depression screening can help identify the presence and severity of anxiety and depression symptoms, which could be contributing to or exacerbating the physical symptoms.

"I'm tired all the time, no matter how many hours of sleep I get...","I've been feeling tired and I'm always lacking energy to do everyday things. I first thought it's iron deficiency again, but that's apparently not the problem. Besides that I have a lot of headaches and am bloated way too often. 
About three weeks ago my energy levels changed...it took me at least 2 hours to fall asleep (wasn't tired at all!)...and when I finally did, I was awake at 6-7 in the morning (I usually fell asleep around 2-3am), full of energy and not feeling tired at all. This period lasted for about 2 weeks and then I started becoming more and more tired during the day and now I've again reached the point where I could sleep for the whole day and still be tired. The waking up part takes a lot of energy and I can't do anything for at least 30 minutes after, because my body is not really happy to be awake. GP says everything's fine...I'm 20 years old female and I don't think everything's fine with being tired all the time.",7,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be considered include:

1. **Hypothyroidism**: Fatigue, headaches, bloating, and sleep disturbances are common symptoms of hypothyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough hormones.
2. **Anemia (not just iron deficiency)**: Although iron deficiency has been ruled out, other types of anemia, such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, could be causing fatigue and headaches.
3. **Sleep disorders**: The described sleep pattern changes, such as taking 2 hours to fall asleep and waking up early, could indicate a sleep disorder like insomnia, sleep apnea, or restless leg syndrome.
4. **Adrenal fatigue**: This condition, also known as hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction, can cause fatigue, headaches, and sleep disturbances due to impaired adrenal gland function.
5. **Depression or anxiety**: Fatigue, headaches, and sleep changes can be symptoms of underlying mental health conditions like depression or anxiety.
6. **Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)**: Hormonal imbalances in PCOS can lead to fatigue, bloating, and sleep disturbances.
7. **Chronic fatigue syndrome**: This condition is characterized by persistent and unexplained fatigue that is not relieved by rest.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Thyroid function tests**: To rule out hypothyroidism, a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test and free thyroxine (FT4) test can be ordered.
2. **Complete blood count (CBC)**: To check for anemia, infection, or other blood disorders.
3. **Vitamin B12 and folate tests**: To rule out deficiencies that could be contributing to fatigue and headaches.
4. **Sleep study or actigraphy**: To assess sleep patterns and identify potential sleep disorders.
5. **Cortisol tests**: To evaluate adrenal function and rule out adrenal fatigue.
6. **Mental health screening**: A questionnaire or interview to assess for symptoms of depression or anxiety.
7. **Pelvic exam and ultrasound**: To check for PCOS or other reproductive health issues.
8. **Hormone level tests**: To evaluate hormone imbalances that could be contributing to symptoms.
9. **Comprehensive metabolic panel**: To assess overall metabolic health and identify potential underlying conditions.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* The combination of fatigue, headaches, and sleep disturbances suggests a potential hormonal or metabolic imbalance.
* The sudden change in energy levels and sleep patterns warrants further investigation into sleep disorders or adrenal fatigue.
* The presence of bloating and fatigue could indicate a reproductive health issue, such as PCOS.
* Mental health screening is essential to rule out underlying depression or anxiety that could be contributing to symptoms.
* A comprehensive metabolic panel can help identify potential underlying conditions, such as anemia or hormonal imbalances, that may be contributing to symptoms."
I wake up in the morning randomly and vomit. Any idea why?,"It started about a year and a half ago during my first year of college. I woke up one day and needed to vomit. Since then, I randomly wake up and vomit or I wake up feeling like I'm about to vomit and quickly try to eat a small piece of bread to calm my stomach. When I do vomit it is usually just bile. Sometimes I will try to eat to calm my stomach but the food just makes it worse and I vomit anyway (on these occasions I'm eating more than just bread).

There's no discernible pattern to it all. I never eat or drink the same things the day before it happens. Sometimes I will be getting less sleep in the days preceding it, some days more, so I don't believe it is related to my sleep patterns. It also happens regardless of where I'm sleeping e.g. home, school, friend's house. Sometimes it will happen (either the vomiting or the morning nausea) just once a month, other times much more.

For context on me:
I'm a 20 year old male. I am 6 ft tall. Middle Eastern descent. Born and raised in the USA. I'm around 210 pounds currently, but when it started I was probably closer to 190 if not 180. Since it started I've fluctuated in weight from 180-190 up to almost 220 down to 190 again and back up to 210. My exercise levels and diets have varied throughout the time it has been effecting me. I have no existing medical issues and am not on any medications.

It's not anything significant or extremely pressing, but I'm just really curious why it suddenly started and has been happening to me. Input would be greatly appreciated.",7,"Based on the symptoms described, here are some possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible Medical Conditions:

1. **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**: The vomiting of bile and morning nausea could be indicative of GERD, which is a chronic condition where stomach acid flows back into the esophagus.
2. **Gastroparesis**: This condition is characterized by delayed stomach emptying, which can cause nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort.
3. **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)**: IBS can cause abdominal pain, nausea, and changes in bowel movements, which may be related to the vomiting and morning nausea.
4. **Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome**: This is a rare condition characterized by recurring episodes of severe vomiting, often with no apparent cause.
5. **Functional Dyspepsia**: This condition is characterized by recurring or persistent upper abdominal pain or discomfort, which may be related to the vomiting and morning nausea.

Recommended Diagnostic Tests or Evaluations:

1. **Upper Endoscopy**: To rule out any underlying conditions such as GERD, gastroparesis, or functional dyspepsia, an upper endoscopy can be performed to visualize the upper digestive tract.
2. **Gastric Emptying Study**: To evaluate the emptying of food from the stomach, a gastric emptying study can be performed to diagnose gastroparesis.
3. **Blood Tests**: To rule out any underlying conditions such as anemia, electrolyte imbalances, or liver disease, blood tests can be performed.
4. **Stool Tests**: To rule out any underlying conditions such as gastrointestinal infections or inflammatory bowel disease, stool tests can be performed.
5. **Food Diary**: Keeping a food diary to track food intake, symptoms, and vomiting episodes can help identify any potential triggers or patterns.
6. **Sleep Study**: Although the patient does not believe sleep patterns are related, a sleep study can be performed to rule out any underlying sleep disorders that may be contributing to the symptoms.
7. **Psychological Evaluation**: To rule out any underlying psychological conditions such as anxiety or stress that may be contributing to the symptoms, a psychological evaluation can be performed.
8. **Abdominal Ultrasound**: To rule out any underlying conditions such as gallstones or liver disease, an abdominal ultrasound can be performed.

Justifications for each recommendation:

* Upper endoscopy and gastric emptying study are recommended to rule out underlying conditions that may be causing the vomiting and morning nausea.
* Blood tests, stool tests, and abdominal ultrasound are recommended to rule out any underlying conditions that may be contributing to the symptoms.
* Food diary and sleep study are recommended to identify any potential triggers or patterns that may be contributing to the symptoms.
* Psychological evaluation is recommended to rule out any underlying psychological conditions that may be contributing to the symptoms.

"22 year old female, no period for 2.5 years. How do I know if I am infertile?","* Age: 22 years old
* Sex: female
* Height: 5'5""
* Weight: 105-110 lbs
* BMI: approx. 18
* Race: white

Hi there--I am a 22 year-old female and haven't gotten a period in 2.5 years, and I'm concerned this means I could possibly be infertile. My access to healthcare and talking to a doctor is a bit limited right now, so while I wait, I've come to post on Reddit and a few other health forums to see if anyone's had similar issues or if any doctors/health professionals might have some answers. Any feedback or insight at all would be very appreciated!
 
Just to provide some background on the issue:

My period stopped in the winter of 2011 and hasn't come back since. This had coincided with the start of an eating disorder (anorexia nervosa), which I know often triggers the loss of periods. At the beginning of winter 2011, I'd weighed around 145 lbs (I'm 5'5"", so this was a BMI of 24.1). By August 2012, I weighed 95 lbs (BMI = 15.8). The weight loss was mainly driven by an extreme reduction in calorie intake, but toward the end there began to be slightly excessive exercise as well. The period stopped just around the same time I began eating less (December 2011).
 
In September 2012 I saw a doctor, was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, and went into IOP treatment for it. My weight went back up to around 110-115 lbs, and my health issues regarding things like low calcium, osteopenia, hair loss, low blood pressure, etc., for the most part improved. Throughout all this time, though, the period never returned.

At this point, I am much healthier as my eating and exercise habits have improved and are for the most part healthy. I have been maintaining my weight around 105-110 lbs, I no longer restrict or purge, and I've been eating enough calories with a normal level of exercise. But I'm very concerned that the history of the ED has or may cause me to be infertile. I'd asked my doctors about the missing periods at the time of the ED treatment and they'd explained periods can stop due to things like fast weight loss, increased anxiety, etc., and that they return once a healthy weight and normal eating habits are restored. However, mine has still not come back.

If anyone has dealt with this before or knows more about testing for infertility or bringing periods back, I'd really appreciate the insight.

Thanks so much in advance for any responses!",7,"Based on the symptoms and history provided, possible medical conditions that may be contributing to the absence of menstruation (amenorrhea) include:

1. **Hypothalamic Amenorrhea**: This condition is characterized by the absence of menstruation due to a problem with the hypothalamus, a part of the brain that regulates hormone production. The history of anorexia nervosa and significant weight loss may have disrupted the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to amenorrhea.
2. **Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)**: Although PCOS is often associated with obesity, it can also occur in women with a low body mass index (BMI). The absence of menstruation, combined with a history of significant weight loss and disordered eating, may increase the risk of PCOS.
3. **Premature Ovarian Failure (POF)**: Also known as premature ovarian insufficiency, POF is a condition where the ovaries stop functioning and menstruation ceases before the age of 40. The history of anorexia nervosa and significant weight loss may have contributed to POF.
4. **Thyroid Dysfunction**: Thyroid disorders, such as hypothyroidism, can cause amenorrhea. The history of anorexia nervosa and significant weight loss may have affected thyroid function.
5. **Pituitary Tumors**: Although rare, pituitary tumors can cause amenorrhea by disrupting the production of hormones that regulate menstruation.

To further evaluate the cause of amenorrhea and potential infertility, the following diagnostic tests or evaluations may be recommended:

1. **Pelvic Exam**: A pelvic exam to assess the reproductive organs and check for any abnormalities.
2. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: A CBC to evaluate overall health and check for any signs of infection or inflammation.
3. **Blood Tests**:
	* **Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing Hormone (LH) levels**: To evaluate the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and assess ovarian reserve.
	* **Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) and Free Thyroxine (FT4) levels**: To evaluate thyroid function.
	* **Prolactin levels**: To check for hyperprolactinemia, which can cause amenorrhea.
4. **Ultrasound**: A pelvic ultrasound to evaluate the reproductive organs, including the ovaries and uterus.
5. **Hormone Level Tests**: Additional hormone level tests, such as:
	* **Estrogen levels**: To evaluate the level of estrogen in the body.
	* **Progesterone levels**: To evaluate the level of progesterone in the body.
6. **Karyotype Analysis**: A karyotype analysis to evaluate the chromosomal makeup and check for any abnormalities.
7. **Referral to a Specialist**: Referral to a reproductive endocrinologist or an obstetrician-gynecologist (OB-GYN) for further evaluation and management.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* The history of anorexia nervosa and significant weight loss increases the risk of hypothalamic amenorrhea, PCOS, and POF.
* The absence of menstruation for an extended period requires evaluation of the reproductive organs and hormone levels.
* Thyroid dysfunction and pituitary tumors are potential causes of amenorrhea that need to be ruled out.
* A comprehensive evaluation, including blood tests, ultrasound, and hormone level tests, is necessary to determine the underlying cause of amenorrhea and potential infertility."
Hello I am a 16 year old female and I need your help.,"I recently tried to have sex with my boyfriend 5 days ago. He used a condom and also pulled out. But 2 days later ive been feeling nauseous and throwing up. I went to take a pregnancy test and nothing showed up. Am I pregnant? If I am is there anything I can do this early in the pregnancy to stop it? But every time I've had sex with him only around 4 times the whole 3 years we have been dating for some reason I always get my period late or I feel nauseous for a little bit.

Ps. I wont be have sex until later when I am ready to have a baby this is scaring me enough to stop it for good. I'm scared out of my mind.",7,"Based on the symptoms you've described, here are some possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible medical conditions:

1. **Early pregnancy**: Although the pregnancy test was negative, it's possible that the embryo is still implanting, and the test may not be sensitive enough to detect the pregnancy hormone (hCG) yet.
2. **Gastrointestinal issue**: Nausea and vomiting can be symptoms of a stomach virus, food poisoning, or other gastrointestinal issues.
3. **Hormonal imbalance**: The nausea and delayed periods could be related to hormonal changes, which may be exacerbated by sex or other factors.
4. **Stress or anxiety**: The symptoms could be psychosomatic, caused by stress or anxiety related to the fear of pregnancy.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Repeat pregnancy test**: Wait a few more days and take another pregnancy test to confirm or rule out pregnancy. If the test is still negative, but symptoms persist, consider a blood test to check for hCG levels.
2. **Complete blood count (CBC)**: To rule out any underlying infections or inflammatory conditions that could be causing the nausea and vomiting.
3. **Urinalysis**: To check for any urinary tract infections (UTIs) or other conditions that could be causing the symptoms.
4. **Hormone level tests**: To evaluate hormone levels, such as estrogen and progesterone, to determine if there are any imbalances.
5. **Pelvic exam**: A pelvic exam can help rule out any underlying gynecological issues, such as an infection or cysts.
6. **Stress and anxiety evaluation**: A doctor may recommend a mental health evaluation to assess stress and anxiety levels, which could be contributing to the symptoms.

Regarding the possibility of stopping a potential pregnancy, it's essential to note that:

* If you are pregnant, the earlier you seek medical attention, the more options you may have for managing the pregnancy.
* If you're not ready to become a parent, it's crucial to discuss your options with a healthcare provider, who can provide guidance on available choices, such as emergency contraception or abortion services (depending on local laws and regulations).

Given your concerns and symptoms, it's recommended that you schedule an appointment with your primary care physician or a gynecologist as soon as possible. They can evaluate your symptoms, perform the necessary tests, and provide guidance on the next steps.

In the meantime, consider the following:

* Practice safe sex or abstinence to avoid any further concerns about pregnancy.
* Keep a symptom journal to track when your symptoms occur and any potential triggers.
* Reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional for emotional support and guidance.

Remember, it's essential to prioritize your physical and emotional well-being during this time."
Incredibly tired for days after orgasm,"I have a girlfriend, and we engage in sexual contact pretty regularly. Although I've started to notice that any time I have an orgasm, regardless if it's from sex or masturbation, I'm ridiculously tired afterwards. People can talk to me and I won't be able to process their words at all. The next day I'll be low in energy and pretty numb to the world. By day two I start getting back to feeling normal. I have my energy back, and I stop feeling numb to sensations. Now this is obviously a big problem because I'm finding myself having to ask my girlfriend for long breaks in between sex because I just can't function at all when I'm having sex.... So please help. I don't want to find myself having to go celibate",7,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be contributing to the issue include:

1. **Postorgasmic Illness Syndrome (POIS)**: A rare condition characterized by excessive fatigue, numbness, and other symptoms after orgasm.
2. **Hypothyroidism**: An underactive thyroid gland can cause fatigue, numbness, and decreased libido.
3. **Anemia**: A condition where the body has a low red blood cell count, leading to fatigue, weakness, and numbness.
4. **Chronic Fatigue Syndrome**: A condition characterized by persistent and unexplained fatigue that is not relieved by rest.
5. **Neurological disorders**: Certain conditions, such as multiple sclerosis or peripheral neuropathy, can cause numbness and fatigue.
6. **Hormonal imbalance**: Imbalances in hormones such as testosterone, dopamine, or serotonin can affect energy levels and libido.
7. **Sleep disorders**: Conditions like sleep apnea or insomnia can cause fatigue, numbness, and decreased energy.

To further diagnose and evaluate the condition, a doctor might order the following tests:

1. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: To rule out anemia and other blood-related disorders.
2. **Thyroid function tests**: To check for hypothyroidism or other thyroid-related issues.
3. **Hormone level tests**: To evaluate testosterone, dopamine, and serotonin levels.
4. **Sleep study**: To assess sleep quality and rule out sleep disorders.
5. **Neurological examination**: To evaluate nerve function and rule out neurological disorders.
6. **Psychological evaluation**: To assess mental health and rule out conditions like depression or anxiety.
7. **Sexual health screening**: To check for any underlying sexual health issues, such as low testosterone or erectile dysfunction.

The doctor may also ask additional questions to gather more information, such as:

* How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?
* Have you noticed any other symptoms, such as pain or discomfort during sex?
* Have you recently started or stopped any medications?
* Do you have any underlying medical conditions?
* Have you experienced any significant stress or life changes recently?

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional to determine the underlying cause of the symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan."
Exactly how much of my past medical info is available to a doctor in a hospital?,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.    
  


Years ago, i cheated on my girlfriend. (it was a one time thing, someone's mouth touched my penis for less than 4 seconds before i freaked out and stopped it).  Afterwards, I went to get tested - i also embellished the story to make sure that the doc would treat me for ghonorrea/chlamydia just in case (i was paranoid.... later, tests all came back negative)        
   
   
this guilt has been crushing me for YEARS (and i deserve it - i am a scumbag piece of shit for letting that happen)   
  
    
     


   
Flash forward a bunch of years.  That girlfriend (now my wife) is about to graduate medschool.    

* If she went to a hospital's computer and punched in my info, could she see that i went in for std screening &amp; was treated in the past?
* would she see any notes from that visit (the story i embellished?)
* The healthcare provider (national chain) has an option for me to request my info and to request that certain info isn't shared...  if i do this, would she see some record of THAT in the system?      

    
   
thanks for the response",7,"Based on the provided symptoms, it appears that the primary concern is not a medical condition, but rather a personal and emotional issue related to guilt and confidentiality of medical records. However, to address the questions posed:

Possible medical conditions: None apparent, as the symptoms described are related to emotional distress and concerns about medical record confidentiality.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Counseling or therapy**: A mental health professional can help address the emotional distress and guilt related to the past incident. This can provide a safe and confidential space to discuss feelings and work through the emotional impact of the event.
2. **Review of medical records and confidentiality policies**: The individual can request a copy of their medical records from the healthcare provider to understand what information is contained within. They can also review the healthcare provider's confidentiality policies and procedures to understand how their information is protected.
3. **Discussion with a healthcare provider or patient advocate**: A healthcare provider or patient advocate can help explain the confidentiality policies and procedures in place, as well as the potential consequences of requesting that certain information not be shared.

Regarding the specific questions:

* **Access to medical records**: Depending on the healthcare provider's policies and the laws in their jurisdiction, it is possible that the wife, as a medical student, may have access to the individual's medical records if she is authorized to do so. However, this would typically require a legitimate need to access the records, such as providing care to the individual.
* **Visibility of notes from the visit**: If the wife were to access the individual's medical records, she may see notes from the visit, including the embellished story. However, this would depend on the specific documentation practices of the healthcare provider and the level of access granted to the wife.
* **Requesting that information not be shared**: If the individual requests that certain information not be shared, there may be a record of this request in the system. However, the visibility of this record would depend on the healthcare provider's policies and procedures for handling confidentiality requests.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* Counseling or therapy can help address the emotional distress and guilt related to the past incident.
* Reviewing medical records and confidentiality policies can help the individual understand what information is contained within their records and how it is protected.
* Discussing confidentiality policies and procedures with a healthcare provider or patient advocate can provide clarity on the potential consequences of requesting that certain information not be shared."
Male Health Embarassing Question,"**Age**: 25
**Sex**: Male
**Height**: 5 Foot 9
**Weight**: 248
**Race**: White
**Duration of complaint**: 9 months of noticable change
**Location**: Penis
**Current Medication:** Propranolol ER 120mg twice daily

This is an embarassing question for me. I am new here so I hope I have the right subreddit for this. 

Several years ago my neurologist, while running tests trying to figure out why I have daily migraines, decided to check testosterone free for whatever reason. It was about 330, just a few points below baseline (348-1197) for the labcorp test. But it was something he was concerned about nonetheless and told me to see my general practicitioner and a urologist. Fast forward a few months and I am on Testim gel around the age of 22 and I eventually go on to androderm because it was more convient. 

I continue this regimine until I am 24 years old and see an endocrinologist to check my hormones. She does a battery of tests. I wish I had the results in front of me. The important thing is that after being on testosterone treatment from age 22-24, my testosterone free measurement only went up to a max of about 360 points. Now this is a bummer because this is only 12 points above baseline, but technically considered healthy. She took me off the testosterone and all my other hormones related were well within range. And yes, I know there is a raging debate in fitness circles and other places about how testosterone in the 300s is still considered low by some people, and I tend to agree with it.

Now, about 9 months later, I get a checkup with a dermatologist 2 weeks ago who, for whatever reason, decides to check my testosterone free and T3 levels. My T3 levels were perfect but my Testosterone Free was 214... As soon as I heard that number my heart sunk because it had never once been below 300, much less close to being 200.

I'm extremely worried about this for several reasons. I am suffering from what I could only guess is penile shrinkage. This has been noticeable for about a year, but it became a problem when nurses were trying to get a catheter in me and explained to the doctor how difficult it was. All I could do is sit there an try not to cry like a baby. 

And it is like nothing I have ever seen before honestly. I have always been normal sized (I'm circumsized), but now it has shrunk so much the foreskin extends past the head of the penis. As if the head of the penis has itself retracted into my body. 

Now, from what I have read on the internet, people who are only high doses of propranolol also suffer from a similar issue of penis shrinkage. Has anyone else had a similar experience with this medication?

I don't know what to do. I'm starting graduate school and I turn down dates because I don't want them to find out about this. The earliest I can see my endocrinologist and urologist both are two weeks from now to get answers from professionals.

But until then, I wanted to know if anyone else has had to deal with a similar issue, whether it was medicine related, a testosterone problem, or just born like it. I just want to be normal again and I already have severe anxiety and depression that I see a therapist and psychiatrist for.

I appreciate any help you can offer. It would help calm my nerves knowing as much information as I could. Also I apologize if I didn't do this correctly or didn't do the title correctly.


",7,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be contributing to the penile shrinkage and low testosterone levels include:

1. **Hypogonadism**: A condition where the testes do not produce enough testosterone, which can be caused by various factors, including pituitary or hypothalamic dysfunction.
2. **Testicular atrophy**: A condition where the testes shrink, leading to decreased testosterone production.
3. **Peyronie's disease**: A condition characterized by the formation of scar tissue in the penis, leading to curvature and shrinkage.
4. **Propranolol-induced penile shrinkage**: As mentioned, high doses of propranolol have been reported to cause penile shrinkage in some individuals.
5. **Endocrine disorders**: Other endocrine disorders, such as hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, can also affect testosterone levels and penile health.

To further evaluate these conditions, the following diagnostic tests or evaluations may be recommended:

1. **Repeat testosterone levels**: To confirm the low testosterone levels and rule out any laboratory errors.
2. **Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels**: To evaluate the pituitary-gonadal axis and determine if there is a problem with the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis.
3. **Thyroid function tests**: To evaluate thyroid function and rule out any thyroid-related disorders.
4. **Prolactin levels**: To evaluate prolactin levels, which can affect testosterone production.
5. **Testicular ultrasound**: To evaluate testicular size and structure, and rule out any testicular atrophy or other abnormalities.
6. **Penile Doppler ultrasound**: To evaluate blood flow to the penis and rule out any vascular-related disorders.
7. **Psychological evaluation**: To evaluate the impact of the condition on mental health and well-being, and to develop a plan to address any related anxiety or depression.
8. **Medication review**: To evaluate the potential effects of propranolol on testosterone levels and penile health, and to consider alternative medications if necessary.

Justifications for these recommendations include:

* The significant drop in testosterone levels over a short period, which warrants further evaluation to determine the underlying cause.
* The presence of penile shrinkage, which is a concerning symptom that requires further evaluation to determine the underlying cause.
* The potential effects of propranolol on testosterone levels and penile health, which need to be considered and evaluated.
* The importance of evaluating overall endocrine function, including thyroid and pituitary function, to rule out any related disorders.
* The need to evaluate testicular size and structure, and penile blood flow, to rule out any testicular or vascular-related disorders.

It is essential to consult with an endocrinologist and urologist to determine the underlying cause of the symptoms and develop a plan to address them."
This is an MRI image of my brain. What makes this happen?,"Image http://i.imgur.com/sA19DJn.jpg shows difference between left and right brain half. Picture is taken from below, looking up.

I took this a MRI scan of my brain a couple of years ago. The reason for it was that I overheard a colleague describe some symptoms of cerebral palsy, which her daughter is suffering from. I recognized some of these symptoms, and went to the doctor to have it checked out. I was already 26 at the time, but never had this looked at before. 

I have been experiencing impaired balance and coordination in the right side of my body (I'm left handed, by the way), as well as slightly impaired vision and very slightly impaired hearing on the same side for as long as I can remember. I never thought there could be something physically wrong with me, but that I just happened to be this way. After the scan, the doctors told me my balance and coordination problems as well as some tenseness in the muscles could be attributed to this damage. My vision, hearing or cognitive functioning should not be affected by it. Is this true? 

My main question is, when does something like this happen to the brain? As far as I know I've been the same way for all my life. Does it occur before or after birth? What specifically causes it, and can it get worse?",7,"Based on the symptoms and MRI scan results, possible medical conditions that may be considered include:

1. **Cerebral Palsy (CP)**: Although the doctors mentioned that the vision, hearing, and cognitive functioning should not be affected, the impaired balance and coordination, as well as muscle tenseness, are consistent with CP. However, the fact that the symptoms have been present since birth and have not changed significantly suggests that CP might not be the primary diagnosis.
2. **Perinatal Stroke or Brain Injury**: The MRI scan shows a difference between the left and right brain hemispheres, which could be indicative of a perinatal stroke or brain injury that occurred before, during, or shortly after birth.
3. **Congenital Brain Malformation**: The abnormal brain structure could be a result of a congenital brain malformation, such as a hemispheric dysplasia or a cerebral dysgenesis.
4. **Hemiplegic Cerebral Palsy**: This condition is characterized by weakness or paralysis on one side of the body, which could be related to the impaired balance and coordination on the right side.

To further evaluate and diagnose the condition, the following diagnostic tests or evaluations may be recommended:

1. **Detailed Neurological Examination**: A thorough examination to assess the extent of the impaired balance and coordination, muscle tenseness, and any other potential neurological deficits.
2. **Developmental and Medical History**: A comprehensive review of the patient's medical and developmental history to identify any potential risk factors or events that could have contributed to the brain abnormality.
3. **Neuropsychological Evaluation**: A series of tests to assess cognitive function, including attention, memory, language, and executive functions, to determine if there are any subtle cognitive deficits.
4. **Sensory Evaluation**: A detailed evaluation of the patient's vision and hearing to determine the extent of the impairments and to rule out any other potential causes.
5. **Genetic Testing**: Genetic testing may be recommended to rule out any underlying genetic conditions that could be contributing to the brain abnormality.
6. **Follow-up MRI or Other Imaging Studies**: Additional imaging studies may be necessary to monitor the brain abnormality and to assess for any potential changes or progression.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* A detailed neurological examination is necessary to fully understand the extent of the impaired balance and coordination and to identify any other potential neurological deficits.
* A comprehensive medical and developmental history is essential to identify any potential risk factors or events that could have contributed to the brain abnormality.
* Neuropsychological evaluation is necessary to assess cognitive function and to determine if there are any subtle cognitive deficits.
* Sensory evaluation is necessary to determine the extent of the vision and hearing impairments and to rule out any other potential causes.
* Genetic testing may be necessary to rule out any underlying genetic conditions that could be contributing to the brain abnormality.
* Follow-up imaging studies may be necessary to monitor the brain abnormality and to assess for any potential changes or progression.

As for when something like this happens to the brain, it is likely that the brain abnormality occurred during fetal development or shortly after birth. The exact cause is often unknown, but potential factors that could contribute to brain abnormalities include:

* Genetic mutations
* Infections during pregnancy
* Trauma during birth
* Perinatal stroke or brain injury
* Congenital brain malformations

It is unlikely that the condition will get worse, but regular monitoring and follow-up evaluations are necessary to assess for any potential changes or progression."
Pins and needles in feet.. something to worry about?,"In February I went on a pub crawl with some friends in awful weather and non-waterproof shoes. My feet were quickly soaked, numb with cold (didn't feel warm until the next morning) and remained sodden for a good few hours that night. For about 5 days afterwards I would have a pins-and-needles type feeling for a few seconds whenever I stood up after taking my weight off my feet (by sitting or lying down, also happened if I took my weight off my feet while doing something active, like cycling and swimming). At night I also noticed my soles were really itchy - not a small surface itch like with a bite, but a kind of tingly under-the-skin kind of itch all over. Didn't think much of it at the time, kind of thought it might have been because they had been so cold. 

On Monday I went into my city and got caught in awful weather with bad shoes again. Torrential rain, flooded roads, had to wade through ankle deep water to cross the street... my feet were again soaked through and as I was spending the day out there and it didn't stop raining they remained sodden for several hours again, though this time (it being summer) they weren't cold at all. Now, a few days later, I have had the same pins and needles and itchiness. Have only just remembered that a similar thing happened in February. 

I'm a Dutch female in my early 20s, normal weight, have never had any health issues and I exercise regularly. I have very thick, calloused skin on my feet and have never had a blister, I also tend to get cold hands and feet easily, my feet in particular taking forever to warm up. I've noticed pins and needles in my feet when standing up and the same itchiness at night a few times before while growing up but can't remember whether that was in a similar situation - the two events I spoke about above definitely make me think it has something to do with them getting so soaked for a long period of time while I'm on them but it seems a little ridiculous that getting wet feet causes this! 

I might be worrying about nothing, I tend get worried when my body does strange things like this because I'm not used to having problems/seeing doctors etc. so I freak out at the small things! If anyone can tell me why this might happen, whether it's normal or if it happens to anyone else (none of my friends get it) I would be very grateful :) 

**tl;dr**  Feet get soaked, remain in sodden shoes and socks for a few hours, causes me to get pins and needles and itchiness in feet for days afterwards... why and is this normal?",7,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be considered include:

1. **Trench foot or immersion foot**: This condition occurs when feet are exposed to cold and wet conditions for an extended period, causing nerve damage and leading to symptoms like numbness, tingling, and itching.
2. **Neuropathy**: Damage to the nerves in the feet, potentially caused by prolonged exposure to cold and wet conditions, could lead to symptoms like pins and needles and itching.
3. **Raynaud's phenomenon**: This condition affects blood flow to the extremities, causing them to become cold and discolored, and may be triggered by cold and wet conditions.
4. **Contact dermatitis**: Irritation or allergic reaction to the wet conditions, shoes, or socks could cause itching and skin irritation.
5. **Poor circulation**: Reduced blood flow to the feet, potentially due to cold and wet conditions, could lead to symptoms like numbness, tingling, and itching.

To further evaluate these symptoms, a doctor might order the following diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Physical examination**: A thorough examination of the feet, including checking for any signs of nerve damage, skin irritation, or poor circulation.
2. **Medical history**: A detailed review of the patient's medical history to identify any potential underlying conditions that may be contributing to the symptoms.
3. **Neurological examination**: Tests to assess nerve function, such as reflexes, sensation, and muscle strength, to determine if there is any nerve damage.
4. **Vascular examination**: Tests to assess blood flow to the feet, such as Doppler ultrasound or ankle-brachial index, to determine if there is any poor circulation.
5. **Skin scraping or biopsy**: A sample of skin may be taken to rule out any skin conditions, such as contact dermatitis or fungal infections.
6. **Electromyography (EMG) or nerve conduction studies (NCS)**: Tests to assess the electrical activity of the muscles and nerves in the feet to determine if there is any nerve damage.
7. **Referral to a specialist**: If the doctor suspects a underlying condition, such as neuropathy or poor circulation, they may refer the patient to a specialist, such as a neurologist or vascular surgeon, for further evaluation and treatment.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* A physical examination and medical history are essential to identify any potential underlying conditions and to assess the severity of the symptoms.
* Neurological and vascular examinations are necessary to determine if there is any nerve damage or poor circulation, which could be contributing to the symptoms.
* Skin scraping or biopsy may be necessary to rule out any skin conditions that could be causing the itching and skin irritation.
* EMG or NCS may be necessary to assess the electrical activity of the muscles and nerves in the feet and to determine if there is any nerve damage.
* Referral to a specialist may be necessary if the doctor suspects a underlying condition that requires specialized care."
My mother is in the hospital and I'm helpless...,"I'm stuck at work 300 miles away while my mom is in the ICU at the moment, I'm wondering if any of the docs here might be able to shed some light or speculate as to what is going on as I myself don't have access to alot of information and a diagnosis has not been made.

My mother is 48 years old, has been quite healthy her whole life.  She definitely may have hit some exhaustion over the past two months.  She also took 3 trips to Delhi, India in the past 9 months.

* For about 30 days my mother has had a **terrible time breathing**.
* It got really bad so my dad took her to see a family friend/doctor.
* This doctor concluded there was **fluid in her lungs, ordered an xray**.
* I do not know what the xray showed, all I know is that an ** ultrasound was then ordered**.
* After the ultrasound they removed **fluid from the lungs, the amount was 2 of some unit.**
* Spoke to different doctor who said they should not have removed that much fluid out at once.
* Mother is now coughing intensely and uncontrollably, we were told this is normal after removing the fluid.

...two hours later...

* I get a message from my dad saying they've moved her to the ICU.

Anyone here have any ideas?

Another reason for the spotty info, my parents are both foreign.  I mean, they've been living in this country for 40 years, but nuanced conversation, especially medical is still going to be a little tough for them to relay to me.",7,"Based on the symptoms and information provided, here are possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible Medical Conditions:

1. **Pulmonary Edema**: Fluid accumulation in the lungs, which could be caused by various factors such as heart failure, high altitude, or infection.
2. **Pneumonia**: Infection in the lungs, which could be bacterial, viral, or fungal, especially considering the recent travel to India.
3. **Tuberculosis (TB)**: A bacterial infection that can cause fluid accumulation in the lungs, particularly in individuals who have traveled to or lived in areas with high TB prevalence, such as India.
4. **Cardiac Conditions**: Heart failure, cardiomyopathy, or other cardiac issues that could lead to fluid accumulation in the lungs.
5. **Pulmonary Embolism**: A blood clot in the lungs, which could cause breathing difficulties and fluid accumulation.

Recommended Diagnostic Tests or Evaluations:

1. **Chest Computed Tomography (CT) Scan**: To further evaluate the lungs and assess for any underlying conditions, such as pneumonia, TB, or pulmonary embolism.
2. **Echocardiogram**: To assess cardiac function and rule out any underlying cardiac conditions that could be contributing to the fluid accumulation in the lungs.
3. **Blood Cultures**: To check for any bacterial or fungal infections that could be causing the symptoms.
4. **Sputum Analysis**: To check for any signs of infection, such as pneumonia or TB.
5. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: To assess for any signs of infection, inflammation, or other underlying conditions.
6. **Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) Analysis**: To assess oxygenation and ventilation status, particularly in the ICU setting.
7. **Cardiac Enzyme Tests**: To assess for any signs of cardiac damage or strain.
8. **Infectious Disease Specialist Consultation**: To further evaluate the possibility of TB or other infectious diseases, given the recent travel to India.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* The symptoms of difficulty breathing, fluid accumulation in the lungs, and intense coughing suggest a pulmonary or cardiac condition.
* The recent travel to India increases the risk of infectious diseases such as TB or pneumonia.
* The removal of a large amount of fluid from the lungs and the subsequent intense coughing suggest a possible pulmonary edema or other underlying condition.
* The ICU admission indicates a severe and potentially life-threatening condition, warranting further evaluation and monitoring.

It is essential to note that these are speculative suggestions, and a definitive diagnosis can only be made by a healthcare professional with access to the patient's complete medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic test results."
"I unknowingly ate an apple and a kiwi, and the pain is starting to kick in.","A while ago I unofficially declared myself allergic to apples and kiwis. My father today made smoothies without getting rid of the skin of the fruits. He told me to just drink it,  so  I did,  believing there were no apples or kiwis. Wrong, both were in there. 

Now I am lying on my bed trying to treat myself because he thinks I'm faking it. I am cramping in my lower right rib cage, my throat is sore, and every time I swallow a wave of pain travels down my esophagus. Lastly,  I am salivating a lot and have to make frequent trips to the bathroom to spit. The spit has an abnormally low viscosity (as in it runs like water out of my mouth).

What can I do? I have a car if I need to get supplies. Right now I'm lying down with my feet elevated, which is doing nothing. 

Thanks in advance.",7,"Based on your symptoms, possible medical conditions include:

1. **Anaphylaxis**: A severe, life-threatening allergic reaction that can cause symptoms such as throat constriction, abdominal cramps, and increased salivation.
2. **Acute esophagitis**: Inflammation of the esophagus, which can cause pain when swallowing and a sore throat.
3. **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**: Stomach acid flowing back into the esophagus, causing pain and discomfort.
4. **Allergic reaction with gastrointestinal symptoms**: Your symptoms could be related to an allergic reaction to the apples or kiwis, which is causing gastrointestinal distress.

Recommended next diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Emergency room visit**: Given the severity of your symptoms, particularly the sore throat, difficulty swallowing, and abdominal cramps, it's essential to seek immediate medical attention. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening, and prompt treatment is crucial.
2. **Allergy testing**: A doctor may order allergy testing, such as a skin prick test or blood test, to confirm your allergy to apples and kiwis.
3. **Endoscopy**: A procedure to visually examine the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to check for any inflammation, ulcers, or other abnormalities.
4. **Complete blood count (CBC)**: A blood test to check for any signs of infection or inflammation.
5. **Electrolyte panel**: A blood test to check for any electrolyte imbalances, which could be contributing to your symptoms.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* Your symptoms suggest a severe allergic reaction, which requires immediate medical attention.
* Allergy testing can help confirm your allergy and guide future treatment.
* An endoscopy can help diagnose any underlying conditions, such as esophagitis or GERD, that may be contributing to your symptoms.
* A CBC and electrolyte panel can help identify any underlying infections or imbalances that may be exacerbating your symptoms.

In the meantime, if you're experiencing severe symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, rapid heartbeat, or severe abdominal pain, call emergency services or have someone drive you to the hospital immediately. If your symptoms are not severe, you can try to:

* Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated
* Avoid any further exposure to apples and kiwis
* Take an antihistamine, such as diphenhydramine, to help alleviate allergic symptoms

"I feel like there's cigarette smoke in my lungs when i breathe out, I've never smoked.","I'm 25 male and have had this for years, it comes and goes randomly and typically lasts about 4-8 hours, and tends to come on every day for a week or so then goes away for several months.

What happens is when i breathe out it feels like i can smell/taste cigarette smoke and there's a slight burning like sensation in my throat, it sometimes makes me cough. It varies in how strong it is but it's pretty annoying.

I've no idea what causes it or what it is, any ideas? I've never smoked, but i was around a smoker until i was 18 but i try to avoid smoke as much as possible, it always makes me cough and makes it hard to breathe as it's so strong.

I rarely come into contact with smokers nowadays, this feeling tends to come on when i'm at home - where nobody smokes.
Thanks.

Edit: Once it's been active for a few hours behind my eyes sometimes feel like they're burning a bit too.",7,"Based on the symptoms described, here are some possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible medical conditions:

1. **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**: The burning sensation in the throat and the sensation of tasting/smelling cigarette smoke could be related to stomach acid reflux, which can cause irritation in the throat and mouth.
2. **Sinusitis or Rhinitis**: The symptoms of burning eyes and throat, as well as the sensation of tasting/smelling cigarette smoke, could be related to inflammation or infection in the sinuses or nasal passages.
3. **Vocal Cord Dysfunction**: The coughing and burning sensation in the throat could be related to abnormal vocal cord function, which can cause irritation and discomfort in the throat.
4. **Allergies or Environmental Sensitivities**: The symptoms could be related to an allergic or sensitivity reaction to something in the environment, such as mold, dust, or chemicals.
5. **Laryngopharyngeal Reflux (LPR)**: Similar to GERD, LPR occurs when stomach acid flows up into the throat and voice box, causing irritation and discomfort.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Upper Endoscopy**: To rule out GERD or LPR, an upper endoscopy can be performed to visualize the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum.
2. **Sinus CT Scan or MRI**: To evaluate the sinuses and nasal passages for any signs of inflammation or infection.
3. **Allergy Testing**: To determine if there are any allergies or sensitivities that could be contributing to the symptoms.
4. **Vocal Cord Evaluation**: A laryngoscopy or videostroboscopy can be performed to evaluate the vocal cords and rule out any abnormalities.
5. **Pulmonology Evaluation**: A pulmonologist can evaluate the lungs and airways to rule out any underlying respiratory conditions.
6. **Environmental Assessment**: A healthcare provider can help assess the home environment to identify any potential triggers or irritants that could be contributing to the symptoms.
7. **Symptom Diary**: Keeping a symptom diary can help track when the symptoms occur and any potential triggers or patterns.

Justifications for each recommendation:

* Upper endoscopy and sinus CT scan/MRI can help rule out underlying conditions that could be causing the symptoms.
* Allergy testing and environmental assessment can help identify any potential triggers or irritants that could be contributing to the symptoms.
* Vocal cord evaluation and pulmonology evaluation can help rule out any underlying respiratory or vocal cord conditions.
* Symptom diary can help track patterns and potential triggers, which can inform further diagnostic testing or treatment.

It's essential to consult a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action and to rule out any underlying conditions that could be causing the symptoms."
Suspected Bladder Issue,"I suspect I may have something wrong with my bladder. I'm male, 25, Caucasian,  197cm tall, and thin at 90kg. I find I have to urinate quite often, usually with a very sudden and extreme urge. I have noticed that the usual bladder irritants, caffiene, sugar, pop, chocolate, all cause me to have to go more often and suddenly, but even avoiding those only helps a little. I also feel that I don't have as large of a bladder capacity as I should.

I have tried pressing my bladder after voiding, to see if I am not emptying it completely, but this doesn't seem to help. I have also suspected a UTI or other infection although I don't have any other symptoms. Still, I tried including flax and cranberry juice in my diet anyways, but I noticed no changes.

This is not a new issue, but a recent job change has made it much harder to deal with. I also think it is getting worse as I find myself more frequently rushing to the washroom in the morning as well as waking up in the night to pee.

I had a few bladder issues as a kid. I was prone to the odd accident and I was a bed wetter for far longer than I care to admit. The doctor always figured it was because I was a very very skinny, fast growing kid. 

Also, there was one month when I was twelve where I had blood in my urine. I went and got checked out, ultrasound and urine sample, but I don't recall them ever figuring out the cause. The doctor just told me to drink lots of water. Sure enough it went away a few weeks later. His theory was that I got hit in a kidney pretty hard while playing sports, which is plausible.

I haven't been to a doctor about this recently and it will be a little while before I can get in to see one. I'll admit, I'm not someone who's very comfortable with doctors. I shrugged this off as having a small bladder for a long time, but some recent advise from a friend has me think it may be something worse.

So if anyone can tell me what I can expect for tests, what to ask about, and any other advice, that will be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks.",7,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be contributing to the issue include:

1. **Overactive Bladder (OAB)**: The sudden and extreme urge to urinate, frequent urination, and decreased bladder capacity are all characteristic symptoms of OAB.
2. **Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)**: Although no other symptoms are present, a UTI could still be a possibility, especially given the history of blood in urine at age 12.
3. **Bladder Outlet Obstruction**: The difficulty in emptying the bladder completely, despite pressing after voiding, could indicate a blockage or obstruction in the bladder outlet.
4. **Neurogenic Bladder**: The history of bedwetting and accidents as a child, combined with the current symptoms, may suggest a neurogenic bladder, where the nerves that control the bladder are not functioning properly.
5. **Interstitial Cystitis**: The frequent urination, urgency, and decreased bladder capacity could be indicative of interstitial cystitis, a chronic condition characterized by bladder inflammation and scarring.

Recommended diagnostic tests and evaluations:

1. **Urinalysis**: To check for signs of infection, blood, or other abnormalities in the urine.
2. **Urine Culture**: To rule out a UTI and identify any potential bacterial causes.
3. **Ultrasound**: To visualize the bladder and kidneys, and check for any abnormalities or obstructions.
4. **Urodynamic Testing**: To assess bladder function, including filling and emptying, and identify any issues with bladder capacity or obstruction.
5. **Cystoscopy**: A visual examination of the bladder using a flexible or rigid scope to check for any abnormalities, such as tumors, stones, or inflammation.
6. **Post-Void Residual (PVR) Measurement**: To check for any residual urine in the bladder after voiding, which could indicate a bladder outlet obstruction or neurogenic bladder.
7. **Medical History and Physical Exam**: A thorough review of medical history, including the history of bedwetting and accidents, and a physical exam to check for any underlying conditions that may be contributing to the symptoms.

Questions to ask the doctor:

1. What are the possible causes of my symptoms, and how will we determine the underlying condition?
2. What diagnostic tests will be ordered, and what can I expect during each test?
3. How will we rule out a UTI or other infection, and what treatment options are available if an infection is present?
4. What are the treatment options for OAB, and how effective are they?
5. Are there any lifestyle changes or modifications that can help manage my symptoms, such as dietary changes or bladder training exercises?

Advice:

1. **Keep a Voiding Diary**: Record the frequency and volume of urination, as well as any symptoms or triggers, to help identify patterns and potential causes.
2. **Stay Hydrated**: Drink plenty of water to help flush out the urinary system and reduce the risk of infection.
3. **Avoid Irritants**: Continue to avoid bladder irritants, such as caffeine, sugar, and spicy foods, to help manage symptoms.
4. **Seek Support**: Consider speaking with a urologist or a healthcare provider who specializes in bladder health to get personalized advice and treatment."
Should I be worried about pregnancy? [A little NSFW],"Hi, I'm a 20y/o female (obviously) about 5'5"", 135lbs, recently became intimate with a new partner. It was not my first time, but I hadn't been with anyone else in almost 10 months. I'm not on the pill because truth be told I didn't think I would be sexually active for a while, but I met someone and I'm leaving for college soon so we decided we wanted to make the most of the time we had. I counted my cycle and we used a condom, but when he went to pull out in the end it came off half way out, and we tried to be very careful but there's a chance some could have gotten on the outside of me and there was more fooling around that could have spread it possibly? I'm not sure quite how easy that is to do. I knew I was due to start my period two days later though so I didn't think it would be a big deal, but when my period didn't come I took a plan B just in case, that was on the 28th day of my cycle, meaning I was sexually active on the 26th, though it was past midnight so really it was the 27th, and then again on the 28th, the day I expected my period, but we were much more careful about incidents that time. My cycle is always slightly off schedule, ranging between 26 and 31 days, but today is day 30 and it still isn't here. I'm starting to get a little concerned because I'm about to go on vacation with my family next week and I certainly won't be able to subtly take a pregnancy test, let alone explain why I wouldn't be drinking... I know stress can put your period off so I'm trying not to worry but there's really no way I can be starting a family right now. Is it also possible that I'm off because I was sexually active for the first time in so long? I also hear that Plan B can put your period off a bit but is it normal for it to be off by more than two days because tomorrow will be day 3? Just looking for some honest expertise, I've never had a scare before so I want to make sure I'm asking the right questions. Thanks!",7,"Based on the symptoms and situation described, possible medical conditions that may be considered include:

1. Pregnancy: Given the recent unprotected sexual activity and missed period, pregnancy is a potential concern.
2. Hormonal imbalance: The irregular menstrual cycle and recent change in sexual activity may be contributing to hormonal fluctuations.
3. Stress-related menstrual irregularity: The upcoming college departure, new relationship, and family vacation may be causing stress, which can affect menstrual cycles.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Pregnancy test**: A urine or blood test to confirm or rule out pregnancy, considering the recent unprotected sexual activity and missed period.
2. **Pelvic exam**: A physical examination to assess the reproductive organs and check for any abnormalities or infections.
3. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: A blood test to evaluate overall health and detect any potential infections or hormonal imbalances.
4. **Hormone level tests**: Blood tests to measure hormone levels, such as follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and estrogen, to assess hormonal balance and potential causes of menstrual irregularity.
5. **Ultrasound**: A non-invasive imaging test to evaluate the reproductive organs and detect any potential abnormalities, such as ovarian cysts or uterine issues.
6. **STI screening**: Tests to detect potential sexually transmitted infections (STIs), considering the recent new sexual partner and potential exposure.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* A pregnancy test is essential to confirm or rule out pregnancy, given the recent unprotected sexual activity and missed period.
* A pelvic exam and CBC can help identify any potential infections or abnormalities that may be contributing to menstrual irregularity.
* Hormone level tests can help assess hormonal balance and potential causes of menstrual irregularity.
* An ultrasound can help evaluate the reproductive organs and detect any potential abnormalities.

Why does my heart rate drop drastically (160bpm to 110bpm) within 20 secs after running?,"When I run my HR is about 160bpm for 30-60 mins. After I stop running (within 20 seconds) my HR drops to 110 and causes me to feel light headed. After another 20 seconds it's back up to 130/140BPM until it recovers down slowly.

Why is this happening?",7,"Based on the symptoms described, here are some possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible Medical Conditions:

1. **Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)**: Characterized by a rapid heart rate and other symptoms that occur upon standing, which may be related to the sudden drop in heart rate after stopping exercise.
2. **Deconditioning or Poor Cardiovascular Fitness**: Inadequate cardiovascular fitness may lead to an exaggerated heart rate response to exercise and an abnormal recovery pattern.
3. **Anxiety or Stress-Related Disorders**: Anxiety or stress can cause an abnormal heart rate response to exercise and recovery.
4. **Autonomic Nervous System Dysfunction**: Imbalance in the autonomic nervous system, which regulates heart rate and blood pressure, may contribute to the symptoms.
5. **Dehydration or Electrolyte Imbalance**: Inadequate hydration or electrolyte imbalance can affect heart rate and blood pressure regulation.

Recommended Diagnostic Tests or Evaluations:

1. **Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG)**: To evaluate the heart's electrical activity and rule out any underlying cardiac conditions.
2. **Tilt Table Test**: To assess the body's response to changes in position and diagnose POTS or other orthostatic intolerance conditions.
3. **Stress Test or Exercise Stress Test**: To evaluate the heart's response to exercise and assess for any signs of ischemia or arrhythmias.
4. **Blood Tests**: To check for dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and other underlying conditions that may be contributing to the symptoms.
5. **Holter Monitor or Event Monitor**: To continuously monitor heart rate and rhythm over a longer period to identify any patterns or abnormalities.
6. **Autonomic Function Tests**: Such as heart rate variability (HRV) testing or blood pressure monitoring to assess autonomic nervous system function.
7. **Cardiovascular Fitness Assessment**: To evaluate aerobic capacity and cardiovascular fitness level.
8. **Psychological Evaluation**: To assess for anxiety or stress-related disorders that may be contributing to the symptoms.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* The sudden drop in heart rate after stopping exercise, followed by a rapid increase, suggests an abnormal autonomic nervous system response, which can be evaluated with autonomic function tests and tilt table tests.
* The symptoms may be related to poor cardiovascular fitness, which can be assessed with a stress test or exercise stress test.
* Electrolyte imbalances or dehydration can contribute to abnormal heart rate responses, making blood tests a necessary evaluation.
* A psychological evaluation can help identify any underlying anxiety or stress-related disorders that may be contributing to the symptoms.
* A Holter monitor or event monitor can provide more detailed information about heart rate and rhythm patterns over a longer period."
I think i had a mini stroke,"My nose started to burn then my lip started to tingle (all on the left side)
Then my arm became heavy and my left leg weakened. I walked a bit walked down stairs and it was mostly gone. Did I have a mini stroke or could it be something else ? ",7,"Based on the symptoms described, here are possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible Medical Conditions:

1. **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or Mini-Stroke**: The symptoms of burning nose, tingling lip, heavy arm, and weakened leg on one side of the body are consistent with a TIA, which is a temporary disruption of blood flow to the brain.
2. **Migraine with Aura**: The burning sensation and tingling could be part of a migraine aura, which can cause neurological symptoms such as numbness, tingling, or weakness.

"Insomnia, fatigue, everything tastes sweet","I am a 34-year-old female, 5'2, 150 pounds, caucasian.  No current medications or issues that I know of.  In the past week, I have had a hard time falling asleep and staying asleep, waking every 3-4 hours.  This has never happened before (I love my sleep).  I've been too tired during the day to attend to my regular chores (I'm a stay-at-home mom) although technically I'm getting 8 total hours of sleep  I thought I might be pregnant, but nope.  Today, I noticed that everything I eat tasted cloyingly sweet.  An indian dish I usually love tasted so sweet I had to throw it away.  Same with other savory foods.  I did a quick google search and, of course, freaked out a little.  Cancer? Diabetes?  WTF?!  It's only been a week of insomnia/fatigue, and one day of weird sweet taste.  However, early breast cancer runs in my family so I'm a little paranoid.  Should I see an actual doctor?  Wait for other symptoms?  Like what?  Thanks!",7,"Based on your symptoms, here are some possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible medical conditions:

1. **Diabetes**: The sudden onset of insomnia, fatigue, and altered taste perception (sweet taste) could be indicative of diabetes, particularly if you have a family history of the disease.
2. **Hypothyroidism**: Fatigue, insomnia, and altered taste perception can be symptoms of hypothyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough hormones.
3. **Anxiety or depression**: Insomnia and fatigue can be symptoms of anxiety or depression, which can also affect taste perception.
4. **Medication side effects**: Although you mentioned you're not taking any medications, it's possible that you may have started taking something recently that's causing these symptoms.
5. **Hormonal changes**: As a 34-year-old female, you may be experiencing hormonal changes due to pregnancy (although you've already taken a test), menopause, or other factors.
6. **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**: Altered taste perception can be a symptom of GERD, particularly if you experience acid reflux or heartburn.
7. **Vitamin deficiencies**: Deficiencies in vitamins like B12 or zinc can cause altered taste perception and fatigue.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Complete blood count (CBC)**: To rule out anemia, infection, or other blood disorders that could be causing fatigue and insomnia.
