<built-in function id>,Throbbing head pain in various situations,"Basically the only thing wrong with me is that I get head pain whenever I stand up or when I sneeze, clench my teeth, or anything else similar. I suspected high blood pressure but I went to the doctor and it was 120/75. The doctor suggested it was from overexertion because I was on vacation in the New England area and did a lot of walking which I'm not used to and possibly a cold virus as well. I was told to take normal doses of Advil, which I did. I was also told it should be gone in a couple of days, but that time has elapsed and it has actually gotten worse when the Advil wears off. Any thoughts?",6,"Based on the symptoms described, here are possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible Medical Conditions:
1. **Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)**: Characterized by a rapid heart rate when standing up, which could lead to head pain.
2. **Cervicogenic Headache**: Caused by referred pain from the cervical spine, which could be exacerbated by standing, sneezing, or clenching teeth.
3. **Sinusitis or Sinus Pressure**: Although the doctor mentioned a cold virus, persistent head pain could indicate ongoing sinus issues.
4. **Low Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Pressure Headache**: Can occur due to a leak in the dura mater, leading to head pain when standing up.
5. **Tension Headache or Migraine**: Could be triggered by various factors, including overexertion, stress, or other underlying conditions.

Recommended Diagnostic Tests or Evaluations:
1. **Imaging Studies**: 
   - **MRI or CT scan of the brain**: To rule out any structural abnormalities, such as a CSF leak or sinus issues.
   - **X-rays or MRI of the cervical spine**: To assess the cervical spine for any potential issues contributing to cervicogenic headaches.
2. **Orthostatic Vital Signs**: Measure blood pressure and heart rate in different positions (lying down, sitting, and standing) to evaluate for POTS.
3. **Sinus Evaluation**: 
   - **Nasal endoscopy**: To visualize the nasal passages and sinuses.
   - **Sinus CT scan**: To assess for any sinus inflammation or obstruction.
4. **Blood Tests**: 
   - **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: To rule out any underlying infections or inflammatory conditions.
   - **Electrolyte panel**: To evaluate for any electrolyte imbalances that could contribute to headaches.
5. **Headache Diary**: Keeping a diary to track headache frequency, severity, and triggers can help identify patterns and potential causes.
6. **Referral to a Specialist**: Consider consulting a neurologist, otolaryngologist (ENT), or a pain management specialist for further evaluation and guidance.

Justifications:
- The symptoms persist despite initial treatment, suggesting a need for further evaluation.
- The head pain is triggered by specific activities (standing, sneezing, clenching teeth), indicating a possible underlying condition that requires investigation.
- The initial diagnosis of overexertion and cold virus may not fully explain the persistent and worsening symptoms, warranting additional testing and specialist evaluation."
<built-in function id>,Father has swollen lymph nodes in his groin area.,According to [WebMD](http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/swollen-lymph-nodes-topic-overview) this may be due to melanoma. If my father has an irregular mole on his cheek and back could the swollen lymph nodes be a result of melanoma?,4,"Based on the symptoms of swollen lymph nodes and irregular moles on the cheek and back, here are possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible Medical Conditions:

1. **Melanoma**: As mentioned, melanoma can cause swollen lymph nodes, especially if the cancer has spread.
2. **Skin Cancer (other types)**: Other types of skin cancer, such as basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, can also cause swollen lymph nodes.
3. **Infections**: Bacterial, viral, or fungal infections can cause swollen lymph nodes, especially if the infection is severe or widespread.
4. **Autoimmune Disorders**: Conditions like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis can cause swollen lymph nodes.
5. **Lymphoma**: Cancer of the lymphatic system can cause swollen lymph nodes.

Recommended Diagnostic Tests or Evaluations:

1. **Biopsy of the irregular mole**: A biopsy is essential to determine if the mole is cancerous. A doctor will remove a sample of the mole and send it to a laboratory for examination.
2. **Lymph node biopsy**: If the swollen lymph node is suspicious, a doctor may perform a biopsy to check for cancer cells.
3. **Imaging tests**: CT scans, MRI scans, or PET scans can help determine if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.
4. **Blood tests**: Complete blood counts (CBC) and blood chemistry tests can help identify any underlying infections or autoimmune disorders.
5. **Physical examination**: A thorough physical examination can help identify any other suspicious moles or skin lesions.
6. **Dermoscopy**: A dermatoscope is a handheld device that uses light and magnification to examine the mole in more detail.
7. **Sentinel lymph node biopsy**: If melanoma is suspected, a doctor may perform a sentinel lymph node biopsy to check if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* A biopsy of the irregular mole is crucial to determine if it is cancerous and to guide further treatment.
* Imaging tests and lymph node biopsies can help determine the extent of the disease and guide treatment.
* Blood tests can help identify any underlying infections or autoimmune disorders that may be causing the swollen lymph nodes.
* A physical examination and dermoscopy can help identify any other suspicious moles or skin lesions that may need to be biopsied.
* A sentinel lymph node biopsy can help determine if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes and guide further treatment.

It is essential to consult a doctor, preferably a dermatologist or oncologist, to determine the best course of action and to discuss the risks and benefits of each diagnostic test or evaluation."
<built-in function id>,Should I continue on my antibiotics?,"I was prescribed antibiotics for a 10 day period because I possibly had strep throat. Today the results came back negative for strep, and I'm 3 days into the antibiotics. I want to drink this weekend but immediately after taking the antibiotics I felt better. I'm wondering if I should stop taking them I have two options:
1) I stop because I have a virus and only felt better after antibiotics as a coincidence
2) I continue taking them because maybe I have some other bacteria and the antibiotics are actually working

My cousin who's a nurse said I should continue for a few more days, but I'm not sure, help?",4,"Based on the symptoms and situation, here are possible medical conditions and recommended next diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible medical conditions:
1. **Viral pharyngitis**: The negative strep test and improvement in symptoms after starting antibiotics could be a coincidence, and the underlying cause might be a viral infection.
2. **Other bacterial infections**: Although the strep test was negative, there's a possibility of another bacterial infection, such as mononucleosis, mycoplasma pneumonia, or a bacterial tonsillitis, which might be responding to the antibiotics.

Recommended next diagnostic tests or evaluations:
1. **Complete the antibiotic course**: As your cousin, a nurse, suggested, it's generally recommended to complete the full course of antibiotics (in this case, 10 days) to ensure that any potential bacterial infection is fully treated. Stopping the antibiotics prematurely might lead to incomplete treatment, antibiotic resistance, or recurrence of symptoms.
2. **Follow-up appointment**: Schedule a follow-up appointment with your doctor to reassess your symptoms and determine the best course of action. This will help your doctor evaluate whether the improvement in symptoms is due to the antibiotics or another factor.
3. **Mononucleosis test (Monospot test)**: If your doctor suspects mononucleosis, they might order a Monospot test to confirm the diagnosis.
4. **Mycoplasma pneumonia test**: If your doctor suspects mycoplasma pneumonia, they might order a test to detect the presence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae antibodies.
5. **Throat culture or PCR test**: If your doctor still suspects a bacterial infection, they might order a throat culture or PCR test to identify other potential bacterial pathogens.

Justifications:
- Completing the antibiotic course ensures that any potential bacterial infection is fully treated and reduces the risk of antibiotic resistance.
- A follow-up appointment allows your doctor to reassess your symptoms and adjust the treatment plan accordingly.
- Additional tests (Monospot, mycoplasma pneumonia test, throat culture, or PCR test) can help identify alternative causes of your symptoms and guide further treatment.

As for drinking alcohol this weekend, it's generally recommended to avoid alcohol while taking antibiotics, as it can interact with the medication and reduce its effectiveness. It's best to wait until you've completed the antibiotic course and consulted with your doctor before consuming alcohol."
<built-in function id>,Do these symptoms mean I should get a colonoscopy?,"My question is about the necessity of a colonoscopy and the sensible timeline for getting one.

I'm 24 and have been having bowel disturbances for about five months -- frequent (at least 4-6 times/day) bowel movements, bloating and gas every evening, and about once a month or two some light rectal bleeding. Besides bloating dull ache, I feel occasional sharp pain in my lower left abdomen. 

Have done tests to rule out common viral/bacterial infections and ulcerative colitis and tried IBS medicine for a month (not much help). 

Saw bowel specialist who is having me get some blood work and another pathogen test done. He recommended a colonoscopy to check for inflammation.

Now, I'm from the US but currently work in New Zealand and would have to pay for the colonoscopy (about $1500-2000) out of pocket if I get it done here. If I wait until I come home in December, my US insurance would probably cover it.

I'm hoping for advice on any danger there could be in waiting. I guess I've gotten used to the symptoms and have found that changing my diet alleviates them a bit. If symptoms go away, would it be a bad idea to forego a colonoscopy all together?

I've read stories about younger people getting bowel cancer and having it go undetected because it's seen as a disease older people get, so that's in the back of my mind.

Complicating or perhaps explaining all this, I was on two courses of antibiotics for unrelated infections during the last four months and three other courses in the past year....and I have had severe food allergies all my life to dairy, nuts and shellfish. When I was younger I had minor allergies to wheat and soy.

I cut soy and wheat out of my diet in the past week and have found some symptoms have improved a bit.





",3,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be considered include:

1. **Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)**: Conditions like Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, which can cause chronic bowel disturbances, abdominal pain, and rectal bleeding.
2. **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)**: A functional gastrointestinal disorder that can cause abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel movements.
3. **Microscopic Colitis**: A condition characterized by inflammation of the colon, which can cause chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, and rectal bleeding.
4. **Colorectal Cancer**: Although rare in young adults, it's essential to consider this possibility, especially given the rectal bleeding and abdominal pain.
5. **Food Intolerances or Allergies**: The patient's history of severe food allergies and recent improvement in symptoms after cutting out soy and wheat suggest that food intolerances or allergies may be contributing to their symptoms.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Colonoscopy**: As recommended by the bowel specialist, a colonoscopy is essential to rule out inflammation, colorectal cancer, and other conditions that may be causing the symptoms. Given the patient's symptoms and family history of allergies, it's crucial to prioritize this test.
2. **Blood work**: The bowel specialist has already ordered blood work, which may help identify inflammatory markers, anemia, or other abnormalities that can guide further diagnosis.
3. **Pathogen testing**: The additional pathogen test may help identify any underlying infections that could be contributing to the symptoms.
4. **Food allergy testing**: Considering the patient's history of severe food allergies and recent improvement in symptoms after dietary changes, food allergy testing may be helpful in identifying specific triggers.
5. **Stool tests**: Stool tests, such as a stool culture or stool PCR, may help identify any underlying infections or inflammatory conditions.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* A colonoscopy is essential to rule out colorectal cancer and other serious conditions, especially given the patient's rectal bleeding and abdominal pain.
* Blood work and pathogen testing can help identify underlying inflammatory or infectious processes that may be contributing to the symptoms.
* Food allergy testing and stool tests can help identify specific triggers or underlying conditions that may be contributing to the symptoms.

Regarding the question of waiting for a colonoscopy, it's generally recommended to prioritize this test, especially given the patient's symptoms and family history of allergies. While the patient has found some relief with dietary changes, it's essential to rule out more serious conditions like colorectal cancer.

Waiting until December to have the colonoscopy covered by US insurance may be reasonable, but it's crucial to continue monitoring symptoms and seek medical attention if they worsen or change. If symptoms improve significantly with dietary changes, it may be possible to forego a colonoscopy, but this should be discussed with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action.

In terms of danger, waiting for a colonoscopy may delay diagnosis and treatment of a potentially serious condition like colorectal cancer. However, given the patient's age and symptoms, the risk of colorectal cancer is relatively low. Nevertheless, it's essential to prioritize the colonoscopy and discuss any concerns with a healthcare provider."
<built-in function id>,Thought I was going to die yesterday.,"I (33 M) was standing in the kitchen yesterday when a wave of dizziness, high bp and heart rate came over me. I couldn't stand, and basically fell to he floor. My wife called an ambulance right away. Lying on the floor, I remained conscious, but really dizzy and I thought I might pass out at any moment. There was a persistent tingling in both my hands. I was scared for my life at this time.

The EMT's came and took my pressure. It was at 163/120 and my rate was at 123 (if I remember correctly). I was taken to hospital, and there I had to wait for 7 hours before seeing a doctor. All this time I felt dizzy, and sometimes it came in stronger. 

They did a complete bloodwork, urine, ecg, and a chest x-ray. Everything was normal there, well as normal as you'd expect from a smoker who drinks a bit more than average. 

I was discharged, went home and slept. Right now I feel a bit weak. I feel a lot better then yesterday, but a little light-headed and weak.

I got to thinking that my anxiety may have been a factor here, but I am no doctor, so that's why I am writing this.

What I am hoping for is a possible explanation for what happened, because when my tests came back negative, it left me a bit nervous.

If any additional info is needed, I'll provide through a PM.",3,"Based on the symptoms you've described, here are some possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible medical conditions:

1. **Anxiety or panic attack**: Your symptoms of dizziness, high blood pressure, and heart rate, along with feelings of fear and weakness, could be indicative of an anxiety or panic attack. Your history of anxiety and the fact that you were scared for your life during the episode support this possibility.
2. **Orthostatic hypotension**: Although your blood pressure was high during the episode, it's possible that you experienced a sudden drop in blood pressure when standing, leading to dizziness and weakness.
3. **Cardiac arrhythmia**: The high heart rate and blood pressure during the episode could be indicative of an underlying cardiac arrhythmia, such as supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or atrial fibrillation.
4. **Neurological disorder**: The persistent tingling in both hands and dizziness could be indicative of a neurological disorder, such as multiple sclerosis, peripheral neuropathy, or a transient ischemic attack (TIA).
5. **Dehydration or electrolyte imbalance**: Dehydration or an electrolyte imbalance, such as low potassium or magnesium, could contribute to dizziness, weakness, and heart palpitations.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Holter monitor**: A 24-hour Holter monitor can help detect any cardiac arrhythmias or abnormalities in heart rhythm that may not have been captured during the initial ECG.
2. **Tilt table test**: A tilt table test can help diagnose orthostatic hypotension or other autonomic nervous system disorders that may be contributing to your symptoms.
3. **Electroencephalogram (EEG)**: An EEG can help rule out any underlying neurological disorders, such as seizures or epilepsy, that may be contributing to your symptoms.
4. **Blood tests for electrolytes and hormones**: Additional blood tests can help rule out any underlying electrolyte imbalances or hormonal disorders, such as hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, that may be contributing to your symptoms.
5. **Stress test or echocardiogram**: A stress test or echocardiogram can help evaluate your cardiac function and rule out any underlying cardiac conditions that may be contributing to your symptoms.
6. **Anxiety or stress management evaluation**: A mental health professional can help evaluate your anxiety levels and provide guidance on stress management techniques to help prevent future episodes.
7. **Sleep study**: A sleep study can help rule out any underlying sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, that may be contributing to your symptoms.

Justifications for each recommendation:

* The Holter monitor and tilt table test can help diagnose cardiac and autonomic nervous system disorders that may be contributing to your symptoms.
* The EEG can help rule out any underlying neurological disorders that may be contributing to your symptoms.
* The blood tests for electrolytes and hormones can help rule out any underlying electrolyte imbalances or hormonal disorders that may be contributing to your symptoms.
* The stress test or echocardiogram can help evaluate your cardiac function and rule out any underlying cardiac conditions that may be contributing to your symptoms.
* The anxiety or stress management evaluation can help address any underlying anxiety or stress that may be contributing to your symptoms.
* The sleep study can help rule out any underlying sleep disorders that may be contributing to your symptoms.

It's essential to follow up with your doctor to discuss these recommendations and determine the best course of action for your specific situation."
<built-in function id>,Daughter is teething and I don't know what this is.,"[Tooth](http://imgur.com/FNgqsaX) in question. Wife sent me this picture of our daughter saying she thinks the little pointed tip is a nerve, making an dentist app first thing monday morning. Did not find any information on google so I figured I'd come here. Also, Thank you guys for this sub. ",3,"Based on the symptoms described, here are possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Tooth fracture or crack**: The pointed tip could be a sign of a fractured or cracked tooth, which may expose the nerve.
2. **Tooth decay or cavity**: The pointed tip might be a sign of advanced tooth decay, which could be close to the nerve.
3. **Enamel hypoplasia**: This is a condition where the tooth enamel doesn't form properly, leading to unusual shapes or pointed tips on the teeth.
4. **Dens invaginatus**: This is a rare dental anomaly where the tooth enamel folds inward, creating a pointed or invaginated shape.
5. **Tooth resorption**: This is a condition where the tooth structure is being resorbed, which could cause a pointed tip to form.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Dental X-rays**: To evaluate the internal structure of the tooth and surrounding bone, and to check for any signs of decay, fracture, or other abnormalities.
2. **Clinical examination**: A thorough examination by a dentist to assess the tooth's sensitivity, mobility, and overall condition.
3. **Tooth sensitivity test**: To determine if the tooth is sensitive to temperature, pressure, or sweet stimuli, which could indicate nerve exposure.
4. **CBCT (Cone Beam Computed Tomography) scan**: To get a 3D image of the tooth and surrounding structures, which can help diagnose conditions like dens invaginatus or tooth resorption.
5. **Referral to a pediatric dentist or endodontist**: If the dentist suspects a complex condition or needs further evaluation, a referral to a specialist may be necessary.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* Dental X-rays and clinical examination are essential for evaluating the tooth's condition and identifying any potential issues.
* Tooth sensitivity test can help determine if the nerve is exposed or irritated.
* CBCT scan can provide a detailed 3D image of the tooth and surrounding structures, which can aid in diagnosing complex conditions.
* Referral to a specialist may be necessary if the condition is complex or requires specialized care.

It's great that you've already scheduled a dentist appointment for Monday. The dentist will be able to evaluate the tooth and provide a more accurate diagnosis and treatment plan."
<built-in function id>,"Strep Throat(?) not reacting to Antibiotics, throat extremely swollen.","Approximately 8 days ago, I started having a sore throat. Very minor, just enough to notice, assumed it was a cold. Fast forward to Tuesday (3 days ago), I woke up with extreme discomfort in my throat, headache, stomach ache, and when I used a flashlight to look down my throat, I could see some white blotches on my tonsils. I go to the doctors, he does a rapid strep test, which did not register for strep, so he sent a throat culture to the lab. But he said it was probably strep, so he prescribed  Z-pak for me, as I am allergic to Penicillin.

It has only gotten worse. While the stomach and head ache's are gone,my throat is very swollen, my uvula and tonsils have become one swollen, sore covered mass, and I cannot eat anything remotely solid. I just took the 4th set of Z-pak pills (2 pills, once a day). Doc was suppose to call yesterday with lab results, I will be calling today.

To make things even more difficult, I'm am currently transitioning between healthcare providers, and I found out on Tuesday that coverage from my first provider has already ceased, and the new one does not start until August 1st. I'm almost hesitant to go in again, and get hit with a huge bill if it is something worse.

Any ideas?",3,"Based on the symptoms described, here are possible medical conditions and recommended next diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible medical conditions:
1. **Strep throat**: Although the rapid strep test was negative, the doctor's suspicion and prescription of Z-pak (azithromycin) suggest that strep throat is still a possibility. The throat culture results will help confirm or rule out this diagnosis.
2. **Mononucleosis (Mono)**: The severe throat swelling, uvula and tonsil involvement, and difficulty eating solid foods could be indicative of mono, especially if the throat culture is negative for strep.
3. **Tonsillitis**: The symptoms of a severely swollen and sore throat, uvula, and tonsils could be due to tonsillitis, which can be caused by a bacterial or viral infection.
4. **Peritonsillar abscess**: The severe swelling and pain in the throat, uvula, and tonsils could be indicative of a peritonsillar abscess, which is a collection of pus behind the tonsils.
5. **Other bacterial or viral infections**: Other infections, such as a viral pharyngitis or a bacterial infection like fusobacterium, could also be causing the symptoms.

Recommended next diagnostic tests or evaluations:
1. **Throat culture results**: The doctor should have received the throat culture results by now, which will help confirm or rule out strep throat.
2. **Mono spot test or EBV antibody test**: To rule out mononucleosis, a mono spot test or EBV antibody test can be performed.
3. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: A CBC can help identify any abnormalities in the blood, such as an elevated white blood cell count, which could indicate a bacterial infection.
4. **Imaging studies (e.g., CT scan or ultrasound)**: If a peritonsillar abscess is suspected, imaging studies can help confirm the diagnosis.
5. **ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat) specialist evaluation**: Given the severity of the symptoms, an evaluation by an ENT specialist may be necessary to rule out any complications or to provide further guidance on management.
6. **Repeat physical examination**: A repeat physical examination by the doctor can help assess the severity of the symptoms and determine if any changes have occurred since the initial evaluation.

Justifications for these recommendations:
* The throat culture results will help confirm or rule out strep throat, which is essential for guiding further management.
* The mono spot test or EBV antibody test can help rule out mononucleosis, which has a different treatment approach.
* A CBC can help identify any underlying infections or abnormalities that may be contributing to the symptoms.
* Imaging studies can help confirm a peritonsillar abscess, which requires prompt treatment to prevent complications.
* An ENT specialist evaluation can provide further guidance on management and rule out any complications.
* A repeat physical examination can help assess the severity of the symptoms and determine if any changes have occurred since the initial evaluation.

Regarding the healthcare provider transition, it may be necessary to seek emergency care or visit an urgent care center if the symptoms worsen or if there are concerns about airway compromise. Some hospitals or clinics may offer financial assistance or sliding-scale fees for patients without insurance coverage."

<built-in function id>,Easy bruising and petechiae,"I've been having this problem for a while, I often find tiny red spots on my skin, especially on my bra line.Also I bruise much easier, ex: I was bitten by a mosquito and after I scratched it for a while I developed tiny red spots and small bruises in that place.I don't have any obvious problems.My thrombocytes are fine, hemoglobin is fine, liver as well and my blood clotting doesn't seem affected, at least if I consider the blood clotting tests I've made.Is there anything else I should check or maybe I can let this go?20,F.",3,"Based on the symptoms described, here are possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible medical conditions:
1. **Vasculitis**: Inflammation of blood vessels, which could cause the tiny red spots (petechiae) and easy bruising.
2. **Platelet function disorder**: Although thrombocyte count is fine, there might be a problem with platelet function, leading to easy bruising and bleeding.
3. **Coagulation factor deficiency**: Despite normal blood clotting tests, there could be a deficiency in a specific coagulation factor, such as factor XIII, which might not be detected by standard tests.
4. **Vitamin deficiencies**: Deficiencies in vitamins like C, K, or B12 could contribute to easy bruising and bleeding.
5. **Skin conditions**: Certain skin conditions, such as eczema or dermatitis, could cause the tiny red spots and easy bruising.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:
1. **Physical examination**: A thorough physical examination to check for any signs of underlying conditions, such as liver disease or lymphadenopathy.
2. **Blood tests**:
	* **Vitamin levels**: Check for vitamin C, K, and B12 deficiencies.
	* **Coagulation factor assays**: Test for specific coagulation factors, such as factor XIII.
	* **Platelet function tests**: Evaluate platelet function, such as platelet aggregation tests.
3. **Skin biopsy**: A skin biopsy to examine the tiny red spots and determine if there's any underlying skin condition or vasculitis.
4. **Imaging studies**: If the doctor suspects an underlying condition, such as liver disease, imaging studies like ultrasound or CT scans might be ordered.
5. **Consultation with a hematologist or dermatologist**: A specialist's evaluation to further investigate the cause of easy bruising and bleeding.

Justifications:
- The symptoms of easy bruising and tiny red spots on the skin, especially on the bra line, suggest a possible underlying condition affecting blood vessels, platelets, or coagulation.
- Normal thrombocyte count, hemoglobin, liver function, and blood clotting tests do not rule out other potential causes, such as platelet function disorders or coagulation factor deficiencies.
- A thorough physical examination and additional blood tests can help identify any underlying conditions or deficiencies contributing to the symptoms.
- A skin biopsy can provide valuable information about the tiny red spots and help diagnose any underlying skin conditions.
- Consultation with a specialist can provide further guidance and help determine the best course of action for diagnosis and treatment."
<built-in function id>,Battling BV,"I am 23/f. The only medication I am on is birth control (Gildess FE 1/20). Any help to get my vagina back to normal would be VERY much appreciated.

In April I went to the Gyno for a yellow discharge and slight fishy odor. My main doctor was not available so I saw a PA. She took a culture and told me it looked like BV. She asked if I had a new partner recently and I said yes back in March I became sexually active with a new boyfriend. This is when my problems started occurring. She didn't think it was an STD but I asked to get tested regardless. The culture came back positive for BV and the STD test came back negative for everything.

She prescribed me some tablets to take over a 2 day period that I cannot remember the name of. There was no change from taking these so she prescribed metro gel to use every night for 5 nights. This helped a bit, but I got a yeast infection as is common after using this. So she prescribed 2 fluconazole tablets to take over 2 days to get rid of the yeast infection. The yeast infection went away but just a few days later the yellow discharge returned.

I went in the office again and saw my regular doctor. She took another culture (came back P for BV) and prescribed me metro gel for 10 days and went ahead and gave me the fluconazole tablets for the yeast infection that would occur after. A few days after finishing this the yellow discharge returned. (Those few days it was gone was absolute heaven)

I emailed the doctor and she prescribed 500mg Metro tablets to take every 12 hours for 7 days. I am on the last day of this and the discharge has been constant throughout. So I know I will have to go back in.

Is there any hope?!?



Other things I have done to try to get rid of this...
*I have changed all panties to 100% cotton
*I changed soap to Dove
*I have made sure I am washing properly (just washing the lips)
*I stopped taking as many baths (I shower typically 2X a day)
*Started drinking more water
*Started eating a cleaner diet and lost some weight
*Started taking vitamins (D, B, C, some days I will only take a multi)
*I started eating yogurt every morning
*I started taking a probiotic
*I tried taking Pro-B probiotic for vaginal health but saw no change and it's expensive so I didn't buy another bottle.
*I've started exercising more (I'm not as good about this one)
*I make sure my partner and I are clean before we have intercourse which has of course been rare since this started. (We don't use condoms as I am on BC he also pulls out as to not disrupt my ph)


I am very scared this isn't going to go away. **I feel absolutely disgusting!** Should I get tested for STD's again? They seem to only be prescribing the one drug. Is this the only one available for this problem? Are there any other steps I can take for vaginal health? I hope I'm not forgetting anything.

Thank you in advance!

I'm posting this for a second time because the first didn't show up even after 2 hours. ",3,"Based on the symptoms and treatment history, possible medical conditions that may be considered include:

1. **Recurrent Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)**: The repeated positive cultures and persistent symptoms suggest that the BV may not be fully resolved.
2. **Vaginal Candidiasis (Yeast Infection)**: The previous yeast infection and the use of fluconazole tablets suggest that this may be a contributing factor.
3. **Vaginal Dysbiosis**: The persistent symptoms and lack of response to treatment may indicate an imbalance in the vaginal microbiome.
4. **Other underlying conditions**: Such as vulvodynia, vulvar vestibulitis, or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), although these are less likely given the symptoms and treatment history.

Recommended next diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Repeat STD testing**: Although the initial test was negative, it's essential to rule out any new infections, especially given the new partner and ongoing symptoms.
2. **Vaginal swab for fungal culture**: To confirm the presence of a yeast infection and identify the specific species.
3. **Vaginal microbiome analysis**: To assess the balance of the vaginal microbiome and identify any potential imbalances.
4. **Pelvic exam and speculum exam**: To evaluate for any signs of inflammation, discharge, or other abnormalities.
5. **Ultrasound or other imaging studies**: To rule out any underlying conditions, such as PID or other pelvic abnormalities.

Treatment options to consider:

1. **Alternative antibiotics**: Such as clindamycin or tinidazole, which may be more effective in treating recurrent BV.
2. **Long-term maintenance therapy**: Using antibiotics or probiotics to maintain a healthy vaginal microbiome and prevent recurrence.
3. **Vaginal probiotics**: Such as Lactobacillus acidophilus or Lactobacillus rhamnosus, which may help restore the balance of the vaginal microbiome.
4. **Antifungal therapy**: If a yeast infection is confirmed, antifungal medications such as fluconazole or clotrimazole may be prescribed.
5. **Hormonal therapy**: In some cases, hormonal imbalances may contribute to vaginal symptoms, and hormonal therapy may be considered.

Additional steps for vaginal health:

1. **Continue practicing good hygiene**: Avoiding scented soaps, douching, and wearing breathable clothing.
2. **Maintain a healthy diet**: Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains to support immune function and vaginal health.

<built-in function id>,neck pain after wake boarding...webmd said cancer :(,"I went wake boarding yesterday night and woke up with my abdomen (6/10), shoulders (4/10), and neck sore (3/10). I figured I was just sore, popped 3 Advil and went about my day. As the day progressed, my neck got more sore.

At 26 hours I was eating chips and went to pore the bag with my head back. Leaning my head back, I went from a 6/10 to a 8.5/10 with a 5/10 headache. I have iced it for 20 minutes now and it has subsided to a 7/10. 

TL; DR - Went wakeboarding, landed on head, neck hurts day after.
Should I freak out?",3,"Based on the symptoms, possible medical conditions include:

1. **Cervical strain or sprain**: The neck pain and soreness, especially after wakeboarding and landing on the head, suggest a possible cervical strain or sprain.
2. **Concussion or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)**: The headache, neck pain, and exacerbation of symptoms when leaning back could indicate a concussion or mTBI, especially given the history of a head injury during wakeboarding.
3. **Whiplash**: The sudden movement of the head and neck during wakeboarding could have caused whiplash, leading to neck pain and stiffness.
4. **Herniated disk or cervical radiculopathy**: The severe neck pain and radiation of pain to the shoulders could suggest a herniated disk or cervical radiculopathy, although this is less likely given the acute onset of symptoms.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Physical examination**: A thorough physical examination by a doctor to assess neck range of motion, strength, and reflexes, as well as to check for any signs of neurological deficits.
2. **Imaging studies**: X-rays or a CT scan of the cervical spine to rule out any fractures or dislocations. An MRI may also be considered to evaluate for herniated disks or other soft tissue injuries.
3. **Concussion or mTBI evaluation**: A doctor may use standardized assessment tools, such as the SCAT-5 or the Concussion Symptom Scale, to evaluate for concussion or mTBI.
4. **Neurological examination**: A detailed neurological examination to assess for any signs of nerve damage or compression, such as numbness, tingling, or weakness in the arms or legs.

As for freaking out, it's understandable to be concerned, but it's essential to seek medical attention to rule out any serious conditions. While the symptoms are uncomfortable, they may be manageable with proper treatment and rest. However, if you experience any of the following, seek immediate medical attention:

* Sudden worsening of symptoms
* Numbness or tingling in the arms or legs
* Weakness or difficulty walking
* Difficulty speaking or swallowing
* Severe headache or confusion
* Fever or chills

It's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to head and neck injuries, and seeking medical attention can help ensure a proper diagnosis and treatment plan."
<built-in function id>,"Black spots on feet, ankles, lower leg","My left leg has a bunch of little black dots, mostly in clusters on each side of my ankle. There are some scars on my lower leg and those have also turned black.

They don't itch, they don't hurt. They're just discolored dots.

The same has happened to my ankle on my right leg, but not nearly as much as the left.

This has been happening for a few months, and I haven't been able to figure it out. Any ideas?",3,"Based on the symptoms described, here are some possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible medical conditions:

1. **Hemosiderin deposition**: This condition occurs when iron from red blood cells accumulates in the skin, causing discoloration. The presence of scars turning black and the clustering of black dots around the ankles suggest this possibility.
2. **Stasis dermatitis**: This condition is caused by poor circulation, which can lead to the accumulation of waste products, including iron, in the skin. The fact that the discoloration is more pronounced on the left leg, which may be more prone to swelling or poor circulation, supports this possibility.
3. **Schamberg's disease**: This is a rare condition characterized by the accumulation of hemosiderin in the skin, leading to brown or black spots. The presence of asymptomatic, clustered black dots on the legs is consistent with this condition.
4. **Vascular malformation**: Abnormal blood vessels can cause discoloration and scarring, which may be related to the black dots and scars on the legs.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Complete medical history and physical examination**: A thorough review of the patient's medical history, including any previous injuries, surgeries, or conditions that may have affected the legs, is essential. A physical examination can help identify any signs of poor circulation, swelling, or other abnormalities.
2. **Dermoscopy or skin biopsy**: A dermatoscope can help examine the black dots in more detail, while a skin biopsy can provide a definitive diagnosis by analyzing a sample of skin tissue.
3. **Venous Doppler ultrasound**: This non-invasive test can help assess blood flow and detect any signs of poor circulation or vascular malformations in the legs.
4. **Complete blood count (CBC) and iron studies**: These tests can help identify any underlying conditions that may be contributing to the discoloration, such as anemia or iron deficiency.
5. **Consultation with a dermatologist or vascular specialist**: A specialist can provide a more detailed evaluation and recommend further testing or treatment based on their expertise.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* A complete medical history and physical examination are essential to identify any underlying conditions that may be contributing to the symptoms.
* Dermoscopy or skin biopsy can provide a definitive diagnosis and help distinguish between different possible conditions.
* Venous Doppler ultrasound can help identify any vascular abnormalities that may be causing the discoloration.
* CBC and iron studies can help identify any underlying conditions that may be contributing to the discoloration.
* Consultation with a specialist can provide a more detailed evaluation and recommend further testing or treatment based on their expertise."

Takes decades to get an appointment with my doctor. I'm kind of just hoping it'll clear up, but if anyone has any clue? 

",3,"Based on the symptoms described in the images, which appear to be related to skin lesions or rashes, here are some possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible Medical Conditions:
1. **Eczema/Dermatitis**: Given the appearance of the skin lesions, eczema or dermatitis could be a possible diagnosis. These conditions are characterized by itchy, inflamed skin and can be caused by a variety of factors including allergies, irritants, or genetic predisposition.
2. **Psoriasis**: The lesions could also be indicative of psoriasis, a chronic autoimmune condition that speeds up the life cycle of skin cells, causing cells to build up rapidly on the surface of the skin.
3. **Keratosis Pilaris**: This condition is characterized by small, rough patches on the skin, often on the arms, legs, or buttocks, and could be a possible diagnosis if the lesions are small and rough to the touch.
4. **Skin Cancer**: Although less likely, it's essential to rule out skin cancer, particularly if the lesions are new, growing, or changing in appearance.

Recommended Diagnostic Tests or Evaluations:
1. **Dermatological Examination**: A thorough examination by a dermatologist is crucial to assess the lesions, their distribution, and any other accompanying symptoms.
2. **Skin Scraping or Biopsy**: A skin scraping or biopsy may be necessary to examine the skin cells more closely and rule out conditions like skin cancer or to confirm a diagnosis of eczema, psoriasis, or other skin conditions.
3. **Allergy Testing**: If the doctor suspects an allergic reaction, allergy testing may be recommended to identify specific allergens that could be causing the skin lesions.
4. **Blood Tests**: Blood tests may be ordered to check for underlying conditions that could be contributing to the skin symptoms, such as autoimmune disorders or nutritional deficiencies.
5. **Photography and Monitoring**: The doctor may ask the patient to take regular photos of the lesions to monitor any changes over time, which can be helpful in diagnosing conditions that fluctuate in severity.

Justifications for these recommendations include:
- The need for a thorough visual examination to assess the appearance and distribution of the lesions.
- The importance of ruling out serious conditions like skin cancer through biopsies or scrapings.
- The potential for allergies or underlying conditions to contribute to the skin symptoms, necessitating allergy testing or blood work.
- The value of monitoring the lesions over time to understand their progression and response to any treatments.

Given the delay in getting a doctor's appointment, it might be beneficial to seek an urgent care visit or consult with an online dermatology service if available, to get an initial assessment and guidance sooner."
<built-in function id>,Ease my worries please,"My husband is about to see a hematologist and googling around has me worried that he's got something serious, like aplastic anemia. I know we'll find out soon enough, but in the meantime, could you please suggest alternative diagnoses that aren't so scary, so I can think positively? 

He is 50 years old, fit as an ox (bike commutes daily), eats healthy, has taken a multivitamin and a baby aspirin daily for decades, is on no other meds, and is in otherwise excellent health -- except for chronic, unexplained anemia. He has had the anemia for at least a decade.  About 5 years ago, his GP sent him for endoscopy to rule out internal bleeding. Then she put him on a course of B12 injections, that did nothing. However a few months later, his anemia then improved enough that there was no further follow up and he was okay. This year he went back for a routine check up and his anemia is back, and worse than ever. He had another endoscopy and a colonscopy. His GI tract is normal, no gluten intolerance, nothing. His B12 and folate is also normal, and his GP no longer thinks it's related to diet/B12 deficiency. She has referred him to a hematologist. She has run a ton of blood tests, everything is normal, except for his hemoglobin, which is below normal. She is also concerned with his low total blood count. His WBC and platelets are within normal range - but at the very end of low. 

Symptoms - he has all the symptoms of anemia you'd expect. Extreme fatigue, weakness, dizziness, fainting spells, sometimes short of breath, pallor, etc. He has a long history of unexplained, massive bruising (like, covering both his thighs, or his mid-torso). This comes and goes and he's never had a blood test or seen his GP during a bruising episode, but he has reported this to his doctor. On and off history of bleeding gums. And this week he admitted to me that his long bones ache. 

He showed me his blood tests so I did see the scores,  but he then took the paperwork away from me and filed them at work. I have asked for a copy and he won't give me one,  because he knows I am prone to worry too much. He tends to worry too, and I know he is much more worried than he is letting on to me. 

",3,"Based on the symptoms and test results, here are some possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible medical conditions:

1. **Iron deficiency anemia**: Despite normal B12 and folate levels, iron deficiency could still be a cause of anemia. Justification: Chronic anemia, fatigue, weakness, and pallor are common symptoms of iron deficiency anemia.
2. **Chronic disease anemia**: Anemia of chronic disease can occur in patients with underlying conditions such as chronic infections, inflammation, or malignancies. Justification: The patient's anemia has been persistent for over a decade, and other causes have been ruled out.
3. **Thalassemia**: A genetic disorder affecting hemoglobin production. Justification: The patient's anemia has been present for a long time, and other causes have been ruled out.
4. **Myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN)**: A group of disorders that affect blood cell production in the bone marrow. Justification: The patient's low total blood count, low hemoglobin, and massive bruising could be indicative of a MPN.
5. **Vitamin deficiency anemia (other than B12 or folate)**: Deficiencies in vitamins such as vitamin C, vitamin E, or vitamin K could contribute to anemia. Justification: The patient's diet and lifestyle suggest a possible deficiency in other vitamins.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Iron studies**: To assess iron levels, transferrin saturation, and ferritin levels. Justification: To rule out iron deficiency anemia.
2. **Erythropoietin (EPO) level**: To evaluate the body's production of EPO, which stimulates red blood cell production. Justification: To assess for anemia of chronic disease or other conditions affecting EPO production.
3. **Hemoglobin electrophoresis**: To evaluate the types of hemoglobin present in the blood. Justification: To diagnose thalassemia or other hemoglobinopathies.
4. **Bone marrow biopsy**: To evaluate the bone marrow's ability to produce blood cells. Justification: To diagnose myeloproliferative neoplasms, myelodysplastic syndromes, or other bone marrow disorders.
5. **Vitamin and mineral panel**: To assess levels of vitamins and minerals such as vitamin C, vitamin E, and vitamin K. Justification: To rule out deficiencies in other vitamins and minerals.
6. **Inflammatory marker tests**: Such as C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) to evaluate for underlying inflammation. Justification: To assess for chronic disease anemia or other conditions associated with inflammation.
7. **Imaging studies**: Such as X-rays or MRI to evaluate the patient's long bones and assess for any underlying conditions that may be causing bone pain. Justification: To diagnose conditions such as osteoporosis or bone metastases.

The hematologist may also consider other tests or evaluations based on the patient's specific symptoms and medical history. It's essential to note that a definitive diagnosis can only be made after a thorough evaluation and testing by a qualified healthcare professional."
<built-in function id>,"Severe shoulder, neck and back pain after tetanus vaccination","A little less than a week ago I received my tetanus booster shot (the one you receive every decade, at least here in Australia).

A few days later I began experiencing pain around my shoulder blade. This has been progressively getting worse, culminating this evening in a stiff neck and severe pain on my upper left back. It got to the point tonight where I could not move from a lying down position without my wife's assistance, and even then, the pain was excruciating. 

From what I've read, such a degree of pain days after the injection is unusual, but not unheard of. As it didn't click initially that my symptoms were related to the tetanus shot, I began treating it like a sports injury and have tried rest and ice. The ice tonight is what made it so bad. I have, therefore hit the pain killers and heat treatment. 

How long can I expect this to last? Is there anything else I can do to hasten recovery and relieve pain? 

Thanks in advance. ",3,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be related to the tetanus booster shot include:

1. **Serum sickness**: an immune system reaction to the vaccine, which can cause pain, stiffness, and swelling.
2. **Brachial neuritis**: inflammation of the nerves in the arm, which can cause pain, numbness, and weakness.
3. **Myofascial pain syndrome**: muscle pain and stiffness caused by inflammation or strain.
4. **Local reaction to the vaccine**: a localized immune response to the vaccine, which can cause pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site.

To further evaluate and diagnose the condition, the doctor may order the following diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Physical examination**: to assess the range of motion, strength, and sensation in the affected area.
2. **Imaging studies**: such as X-rays or an MRI, to rule out any underlying conditions that may be causing the pain, such as a fracture or a herniated disk.
3. **Electromyography (EMG)**: to assess the electrical activity of the muscles and nerves in the affected area.
4. **Blood tests**: to check for signs of inflammation or infection, such as elevated white blood cell count or C-reactive protein (CRP) levels.

To hasten recovery and relieve pain, the following recommendations can be made:

1. **Continue heat treatment**: as it seems to have provided some relief, heat therapy can help relax the muscles and increase blood flow to the affected area.
2. **Pain management**: continue taking painkillers as directed, and consider consulting with a doctor about alternative pain management options, such as muscle relaxants or corticosteroids.
3. **Rest and avoid heavy lifting**: avoid activities that may exacerbate the condition, and take regular breaks to rest and stretch.
4. **Physical therapy**: a physical therapist can help improve range of motion, strength, and flexibility in the affected area, and provide guidance on proper posture and body mechanics.
5. **Follow-up appointment**: schedule a follow-up appointment with the doctor to monitor the condition and adjust the treatment plan as needed.

The duration of the condition can vary depending on the underlying cause, but with proper treatment and care, most people can expect to recover within 1-4 weeks. However, it's essential to consult with a doctor to determine the best course of treatment and to rule out any underlying conditions that may require more extensive treatment."

* [two](http://imgur.com/9w1QWlY)
* [three](http://imgur.com/TVDxF0H)

Any idea what these are? The one on my cheek started off as a small scab (maybe a zit or something). I definitely scratched it inadvertently at least once. Since then, it has gotten a bit bigger. It doesn't quite scab over as you can sort of see. The skin feels tight around it. 

The marks on my jaw (you can sort of see it in all of them, but ""three"" focuses on it – albeit, a bit washed out from the light) are similar to the one on my cheek. Some dead skin/sort-of-a-scab flaked off today leaving some fresh-pink skin.

The facial hair is sort of a new thing, so I thought they might be caused by some irritation/ingrown hairs, but that doesn't seem quite right from my previous experiences. I also have about two marks (similar to the stuff on my jaw I suppose) that might be related or simply caused by the irritation of my beard. 

Any help would be seriously appreciated. ",3,"Based on the symptoms described, here are some possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible medical conditions:
1. **Folliculitis**: an inflammation of the hair follicles, which could be caused by ingrown hairs, bacterial or fungal infections.
2. **Acne**: given the initial appearance of a small scab or zit, acne could be a possible diagnosis.
3. **Keratosis Pilaris**: a skin condition characterized by small, rough patches on the skin, which could be related to the dead skin and scab-like appearance.
4. **Eczema/Dermatitis**: an allergic reaction or skin irritation could be causing the tight skin and scab-like lesions.
5. **Impetigo**: a bacterial skin infection that can cause red sores, scabs, and crusty patches.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:
1. **Physical examination**: a doctor should examine the affected areas to assess the size, shape, and appearance of the lesions, as well as check for any other symptoms such as redness, swelling, or discharge.
2. **Skin scraping or biopsy**: to rule out fungal or bacterial infections, a skin scraping or biopsy may be necessary to examine the skin cells and tissue.
3. **Wood's lamp examination**: to check for fungal or bacterial infections, a Wood's lamp can be used to illuminate the affected area, which may help identify the underlying cause.
4. **Patch testing**: to determine if the lesions are caused by an allergic reaction, patch testing may be recommended to identify any potential allergens.
5. **Blood tests**: to rule out any underlying conditions, such as autoimmune disorders or nutritional deficiencies, blood tests may be ordered.

Justifications for each recommendation:
- A physical examination is necessary to assess the affected areas and determine the extent of the condition.
- Skin scraping or biopsy can help identify the underlying cause of the lesions, such as a fungal or bacterial infection.
- Wood's lamp examination can help identify fungal or bacterial infections, which may not be visible to the naked eye.
- Patch testing can help determine if the lesions are caused by an allergic reaction, which can inform treatment decisions.
- Blood tests can help rule out any underlying conditions that may be contributing to the symptoms.

It's essential to consult a doctor or dermatologist for a proper evaluation and diagnosis, as they can assess the symptoms and recommend the most appropriate diagnostic tests and treatment options."

I know these are shit, but I am guessing not that important.",3,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions include:

1. **Lip laceration**: The patient has already received stitches for the laceration, which is a common treatment for this type of injury.
2. **Hematoma**: The swelling and hardness of the lip could be indicative of a hematoma, which is a collection of blood outside of blood vessels.
3. **Contusion**: The fall from the bike could have caused a contusion, which is a bruise that can cause swelling and pain.

To aid in the healing process and reduce the swelling, the following diagnostic tests or evaluations may be recommended:

1. **Follow-up examination**: A doctor may want to examine the lip again to check on the healing progress, remove the stitches (if they are not dissolvable), and assess for any signs of infection.
2. **Imaging studies (e.g., X-rays or CT scans)**: Although unlikely, the doctor may order imaging studies to rule out any underlying fractures or other injuries that could be contributing to the swelling.
3. **Wound care evaluation**: A doctor or nurse may evaluate the wound to ensure it is healing properly and provide guidance on wound care, including keeping the area clean and applying topical ointments to promote healing.

To promote healing and reduce the swelling, the doctor may recommend:

1. **Cold compresses**: Applying a cold compress to the affected area can help reduce swelling and ease pain.
2. **Elevation**: Elevating the head while sleeping can help reduce swelling by allowing gravity to drain fluid away from the affected area.
3. **Topical ointments**: Applying topical ointments, such as antibiotic ointment or vitamin E oil, can help promote healing and reduce the appearance of scars.
4. **Pain management**: Over-the-counter pain medications, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, can help manage pain and discomfort.
5. **Soft food diet**: Eating soft foods and avoiding spicy or acidic foods can help reduce discomfort and promote healing.

It is near the arch of my left foot, on the inside of the arch kind of. I will notice it maybe 5 - 10 times per day.

EDIT:* I have anxiety issues and sometimes I wonder if it is related to my anxiety.",3,"Based on the symptoms described, here are some possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible medical conditions:

1. **Neuroma or nerve entrapment**: The brief, intermittent ""hot"" sensation in a specific area of the foot could be related to a neuroma or nerve entrapment, which can cause abnormal sensations such as burning or tingling.
2. **Peripheral neuropathy**: Although the patient doesn't have any known underlying health conditions like diabetes, peripheral neuropathy can still occur due to other causes such as vitamin deficiencies or trauma.
3. **Anxiety-related somatic symptoms**: The patient's anxiety issues could be contributing to the sensation, as anxiety can manifest as physical symptoms such as tingling or burning sensations.
4. **Plantar fasciitis or other musculoskeletal issues**: The location of the sensation near the arch of the foot could be related to musculoskeletal issues such as plantar fasciitis or strain on the foot muscles.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Physical examination**: A thorough physical examination of the foot and ankle to assess for any signs of trauma, inflammation, or musculoskeletal issues.
2. **Neurological examination**: A neurological examination to assess for any signs of nerve damage or neuropathy, such as decreased sensation or reflexes.
3. **Electromyography (EMG) or nerve conduction studies (NCS)**: These tests can help diagnose nerve damage or neuropathy by measuring the electrical activity of muscles and nerves.
4. **Imaging studies (e.g., X-ray, MRI, or ultrasound)**: Imaging studies can help rule out any underlying structural issues such as bone spurs, cysts, or tumors that could be causing the sensation.
5. **Vitamin B12 level**: A vitamin B12 deficiency can cause peripheral neuropathy, so checking the patient's vitamin B12 level may be helpful.
6. **Anxiety assessment**: A thorough assessment of the patient's anxiety issues and their potential impact on physical symptoms, including referral to a mental health professional if necessary.
7. **Orthotics or shoe wear assessment**: An assessment of the patient's shoe wear and orthotics to ensure that they are not contributing to the sensation.

What the hell is going on? My diet is wheat free, gluten free, diary free, no artificial stuff, no pastas or rice, pure organic. 

",3,"Based on the symptoms and dietary changes, here are possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible medical conditions:

1. **Malabsorption**: The sticky, dark green/brown, and smelly stool could indicate malabsorption of nutrients, particularly fat. This might be due to an imbalance of gut bacteria or an issue with pancreatic enzyme production.
2. **Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO)**: The high fiber and low carbohydrate diet may be contributing to an overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine, leading to malabsorption and altered stool characteristics.
3. **Gallbladder or Liver Issues**: The dark green/brown color of the stool could indicate a problem with bile production or gallbladder function, which might be affecting fat absorption.
4. **Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)**: Although the diet is free from common irritants, it's possible that an underlying inflammatory condition, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, could be causing the symptoms.
5. **Pancreatic Insufficiency**: The smelly and sticky stool could be a sign of pancreatic insufficiency, where the pancreas is not producing enough enzymes to properly digest food.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Stool Tests**:
	* Stool culture: to check for bacterial overgrowth or infection.
	* Stool microscopy: to examine the stool for signs of malabsorption, such as undigested food particles or excess fat.
	* Stool tests for pancreatic enzymes: to assess pancreatic function.
2. **Blood Tests**:
	* Complete Blood Count (CBC): to rule out anemia or infection.
	* Liver function tests: to assess liver health and bile production.
	* Pancreatic enzyme tests: to evaluate pancreatic function.
3. **Imaging Studies**:
	* Abdominal ultrasound: to evaluate the gallbladder and liver.
	* Endoscopy or colonoscopy: to visualize the small intestine and colon for signs of inflammation or disease.
4. **Dietary Evaluation**:
	* Consult a registered dietitian or nutritionist to assess the diet's nutritional adequacy and potential imbalances.
	* Consider a temporary reintroduction of small amounts of gluten, dairy, or other potentially irritating foods to assess tolerance.
5. **Gastrointestinal Motility Tests**:
	* Gastric emptying study: to assess the movement of food through the stomach and small intestine.
	* Colonic transit study: to evaluate the movement of stool through the colon.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* The stool tests will help identify any underlying bacterial or pancreatic issues contributing to the symptoms.
* Blood tests will provide information on overall health, liver function, and pancreatic enzyme production.
* Imaging studies will help evaluate the gallbladder, liver, and small intestine for any signs of disease or inflammation.
* A dietary evaluation will help identify any potential nutritional imbalances or intolerances that may be contributing to the symptoms.
* Gastrointestinal motility tests will assess the movement of food and stool through the digestive system, which may be affected by the diet or underlying conditions."
<built-in function id>,"Stomach upset, anxiety, sleep cycle screwy: What's wrong with me?!","Warning, long post. There's a tl;dr at the end, but you'd be missing a lot of background! :P  Also, I know the whole ""Reddit is not a substitute for professional medical advice"", I'm just trying to see if anyone has experienced anything similar / has any advice.  I'm not the kind of person who really ever goes to the doctor, and if a lifestyle change could help me I'd much rather do that first than spend thousands of dollars to have a doctor tell me the same thing.  However, this has been going on for over a year now and is impacting my life, and I want to do something about it if possible.

Quick about me: Male, 26, 6ft 145lb.

Current complaint:

Basically the biggest issue is that my stomach seems rather overly sensitive.  Every morning it feels uncomfortable / bloated, whether I force myself to eat something or not.  This often persists through the afternoon, and on occasion the entire day.  The discomfort is not so much pain as it is pressure, mild nausea, and bloating / the need to burp.  Sometimes antacids help a little, although that may just be placebo, and forcing myself to burp can help too. BM's range from 3 to 6 on the Bristol scale, varying on a near daily basis, and with the sense that things are not spending more than 12-24 hours in the GI system.  

This issue causes my second complaint, or is perhaps caused by, or perhaps they feed each other, which is kind of anxiety.  That is, when my stomach is upset, it makes me worry about it, which probably makes it more upset.  I'll start worrying that this time my stomach is going to be a little more upset than normal and I'll vomit, or that people will notice my discomfort, or... well, it's hard to describe because I know it's not really a logical feeling, but suffice to say my upset stomach can make me feel quite anxious especially when I'm around other people.

A third thing that may factor in to this situation is my sleep cycle.  I am currently trying to get a good amount of sleep, usually going to bed between 11 and 12, and waking up usually around 9am. Despite this, when I wake up I still feel incredibly tired (though not always sleepy, sometimes I wake up naturally but still feel groggy and tired).  I really can't get going sometimes until 10am, and I'm usually still a bit out of it (and worrying about my upset stomach) for the rest of the morning.


Background:

As for the stomach issue, I don't know where this is coming from. Growing up I was never particularly food sensitive (though I did tend to be a picky eater).  I believe I am mildly lactose intolerant, although I never ate very many milk products anyway -- don't like cheese or yogurt or drinking milk, that pretty much leaves ice cream, and these days I take lactaid with ice cream.  Last year I discovered that I'm apparently allergic to bananas; I had started eating bananas in 2012 and would have them as snacks, but at the same time my digestive health was going downhill, painful upset stomachs and occasionally bloody stool. Took me some time to make the connection, but I eventually realized that my stomach always became upset 15-20 minutes after eating a banana.  Stopped eating them and improved immediately.  However, I guess I'd say I never went quite back to normal, because since them I've been experiencing the symptoms described above.

I'd also classify myself as eating generally decently, I eat out some and cook for myself some, eat a mix of fruits, vegetables, meats, and pastathings, drink probably 80oz of water a day and a little fruit juice, not too into sweet foods / drinks, rarely ever drink alcohol or anything with caffeine. I'm underweight if anything.

For the anxiety, well, I'm not entirely surprised at myself. I've always been extraordinarily shy / had social anxiety issues.  Any time I'm entering a new situation or one where I'm not in control, I'm likely to feel some anxiety.  In my younger years I believe I suffered from depression; though it was never diagnosed or treated, I was really pessimistic about life and occasionally mildly suicidal. In the past 5-6 years, my mental state has dramatically improved with respect to the depression, and I've gained some confidence, but I'm still likely to be very anxious and/or awkward in social situations.  I suppose in my current situation, it's the fact that I can't control my stomach upset, and it might be noticed by others, and it might be potentially embarrassing, that causes my anxiety. Alternately, I'm experiencing stress / generalized anxiety which manifests as an overly sensitive stomach -- this is something I am not really certain about, is the anxiety an amplifying factor in a physical stomach condition, or is an upset stomach a psychosomatic response to a mental condition?

As for my sleep cycle, I've always been a ""night owl"" and have always functioned better at night. That said, in high school and before I had to get up early, and was able to do so without these issues. Throughout college, I also kept a generally earlier schedule.  It's only been the past couple years that I've just been unable to function well in the morning (oh, and if I force myself to get up earlier, my stomach will be even more upset throughout the day).  It doesn't matter if I go to bed at 9pm or at midnight, I still can't function in the morning (and I'll sometimes still take a nap for an hour or two in the late afternoon).  I'd almost describe myself as delayed-phase sleep disorder, because sometimes when I decide to stay up late working, I'll feel best and get the most done from like 11pm to 3-4am.  



So, Reddit, what do you think?  Do I have some physical issue causing my digestive upset, and if so is it some chronic lifelong thing, or something that could be treated / mitigated?  Or do I have some mental issue that's manifesting itself as sleep cycle problems and upset stomach?  Or do I have a sleep disorder that's causing stomach and mood disturbances? or do I have a bad case of intestinal gnomes?

tl;dr:  Suffering from chronic upset stomach (lack of appetite, nausea, bloating and discomfort); anxiety; and delayed sleep cycle / inability to function in the morning.  All three seem to be related, but I'm not sure what the core issue is nor what to do about it.  However, this has been going on for a while and is negatively impacting my quality of life, so I want to figure something out.",3,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be contributing to the issues include:

1. **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)**: The chronic stomach discomfort, bloating, and changes in bowel movements are consistent with IBS. The fact that the symptoms are exacerbated by anxiety and stress also supports this diagnosis.
2. **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**: The morning discomfort and bloating could be related to acid reflux, which is common in people with GERD.
3. **Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO)**: The bloating, discomfort, and changes in bowel movements could be related to an overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine.
4. **Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome**: The difficulty waking up in the morning and feeling tired despite getting enough sleep is consistent with this sleep disorder.
5. **Generalized Anxiety Disorder**: The anxiety and worry about the stomach issues and social situations could be contributing to the overall symptoms.
6. **Lactose Intolerance**: Although the individual takes Lactaid with ice cream, they may still be experiencing some lactose intolerance symptoms.
7. **Food Intolerances**: The individual's history of being a picky eater and having a reaction to bananas suggests that they may have other food intolerances that are contributing to their symptoms.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Upper Endoscopy**: To rule out any underlying conditions such as GERD, ulcers, or inflammation in the stomach and esophagus.
2. **Colonoscopy**: To rule out any underlying conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer.
3. **Stool Tests**: To check for SIBO, lactose intolerance, or other gastrointestinal infections.
4. **Sleep Study**: To evaluate the individual's sleep patterns and diagnose any underlying sleep disorders.
5. **Anxiety and Depression Screening**: To assess the individual's mental health and determine if they would benefit from therapy or medication.
6. **Food Diary**: To track the individual's food intake and identify any potential food triggers for their symptoms.
7. **Lactose Intolerance Test**: To confirm the individual's lactose intolerance and determine the best course of treatment.
8. **Gastrointestinal Motility Testing**: To evaluate the movement of food through the digestive system and diagnose any underlying motility disorders.

Justifications for each recommendation:

* Upper Endoscopy and Colonoscopy: To rule out any underlying conditions that could be contributing to the stomach symptoms.
* Stool Tests: To check for SIBO, lactose intolerance, or other gastrointestinal infections that could be contributing to the symptoms.
* Sleep Study: To evaluate the individual's sleep patterns and diagnose any underlying sleep disorders that could be contributing to the fatigue and morning grogginess.
* Anxiety and Depression Screening: To assess the individual's mental health and determine if they would benefit from therapy or medication to manage their anxiety and depression.
* Food Diary: To track the individual's food intake and identify any potential food triggers for their symptoms.
* Lactose Intolerance Test: To confirm the individual's lactose intolerance and determine the best course of treatment.
* Gastrointestinal Motility Testing: To evaluate the movement of food through the digestive system and diagnose any underlying motility disorders that could be contributing to the symptoms.

It is essential to consult a healthcare professional to determine the best course of action and to rule out any underlying conditions that could be contributing to the symptoms."
<built-in function id>,Daughter running high fevers and very agitated,"My four year old daughter is running high fevers 102-104 for a couple of days and has vomited twice 24 hours apart and is very agitated. We took her to the pediatrician and she said her lungs sounded okay and her ears were totally fine. She said that her throat was red and ordered a flu and strep swab. Both of those were negative so she said she believes that it is an upper respiratory infection and to wait a week and come back if she is not better, offering nothing more than Tylenol. My daughter has been sick many times but this time just feels different than the previous times that my daughter has been sick because she is very agitated and can't sleep more than 10 minutes without waking up. Normally when she gets sick she will be very drowsy and knocked out. I can draw on my own personal experiences that when I get sick and I cannot sleep and I am super agitated as opposed to drowsy it has always been a bacterial infection. I am upset that the doctor didn't order a blood test to determine if it is bacterial or viral. I don't want my daughter to suffer a week and risk complications if it is bacterial because the doctor didn't order a simple blood test. ",3,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be considered include:

1. **Bacterial infection**: The high fever, agitation, and vomiting could be indicative of a bacterial infection, such as pneumonia, meningitis, or sepsis.
2. **Viral infection**: The pediatrician's initial diagnosis of an upper respiratory infection could still be a possibility, with the agitation and sleep disturbance being atypical but not uncommon presentations.
3. **Urinary tract infection (UTI)**: The symptoms of high fever, agitation, and vomiting could also be consistent with a UTI, especially in a young child.
4. **Meningitis**: Although the pediatrician checked the ears and lungs, meningitis is a serious condition that can present with fever, agitation, and sleep disturbance.

Recommended next diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: A CBC can help determine if the infection is bacterial or viral by looking at the white blood cell count and differential.
2. **Blood culture**: A blood culture can help identify the presence of bacteria in the blood and guide antibiotic treatment if necessary.
3. **Urinalysis**: A urinalysis can help diagnose a UTI, which could be causing the symptoms.
4. **Imaging studies**: A chest X-ray or abdominal X-ray may be considered to rule out pneumonia or other complications.
5. **Lumbar puncture (LP)**: If meningitis is suspected, an LP may be necessary to collect cerebrospinal fluid for analysis.
6. **Electrolyte panel**: An electrolyte panel can help assess the child's hydration status and electrolyte balance, especially if she has been vomiting.
7. **Repeat physical examination**: A repeat physical examination by a pediatrician or a specialist (e.g., infectious disease specialist) may be helpful to reassess the child's condition and look for any new signs or symptoms.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* The child's symptoms, such as high fever, agitation, and vomiting, are concerning and warrant further evaluation to determine the underlying cause.
* The negative flu and strep swabs do not rule out other bacterial or viral infections.
* The pediatrician's initial diagnosis of an upper respiratory infection may not be sufficient, given the child's atypical presentation and the parent's concerns.
* A more comprehensive diagnostic workup is necessary to rule out serious conditions like meningitis, sepsis, or UTI.
* The parent's personal experience with bacterial infections and the child's symptoms suggest that a bacterial infection should be considered and investigated further."
<built-in function id>,"Exhausted, out of breath","Hi everyone, Today I went to another city with my mother and a friend of hers. The man is 58 of age and can't walk more then 20 meters without being totally incapable of continuing to walk by being out of breath completely and exhausted. He has this inhaler he has to use which he got from a doctor, but the inhaler doesn't do a damn thing as it's the same story 5 minutes later. I noticed he doesn't breath like it should, slow and under control. He takes big gasps trough his nose with each breath he takes, you can see his whole torso move with each breath. We talked about it, he says his doctor told him to stop smoking, eventho he hasn't been a hard smoker, and only smokes about 3 sigarettes a day now. It's been stated before by some specialist that his lung capacity is smaller, but I've honnestly never seen a grown man struggle that bad over such small distances. They checked his blood, rayed his lungs, they say he's fine and in good condition. I however can't bear to see him suffer in this way, I wonder if this is a known thing? Are these doctors of him ignoring other possibilities? I guess what I would like to know, is that if there is medication for shortness of breath other then cheap asmatic inhalers that don't work. And if there is a way to progresively increase his lung capacity? He is a very frail man that had some rough injuries if it interests. Thank you for your time.",2,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be contributing to the man's shortness of breath and exhaustion include:

1. **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)**: Despite the inhaler not being effective, COPD is still a possibility, especially given the man's history of smoking. The fact that he has a smaller lung capacity and experiences shortness of breath with minimal exertion supports this diagnosis.
2. **Pulmonary Fibrosis**: This condition, characterized by scarring of lung tissue, can lead to shortness of breath and decreased lung capacity. The man's history of rough injuries and possible exposure to environmental toxins may be contributing factors.
3. **Heart Failure**: The man's exhaustion and shortness of breath with minimal exertion could be indicative of heart failure, which can lead to decreased lung function and capacity.
4. **Anemia**: Anemia can cause shortness of breath, fatigue, and weakness, which may be contributing to the man's symptoms.
5. **Musculoskeletal or Neurological Conditions**: The man's history of rough injuries may be contributing to his frailty and shortness of breath, potentially due to musculoskeletal or neurological conditions such as spinal cord injuries or muscular dystrophy.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs)**: To assess lung function and capacity, including spirometry, lung volumes, and diffusion capacity.
2. **Cardiac Evaluation**: To rule out heart failure, including echocardiogram, electrocardiogram (ECG), and cardiac enzyme tests.
3. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: To check for anemia or other blood disorders.
4. **High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) Scan**: To evaluate lung tissue and rule out conditions such as pulmonary fibrosis.
5. **Six-Minute Walk Test**: To assess the man's exercise tolerance and oxygen saturation during physical activity.
6. **Oxygen Saturation Monitoring**: To evaluate the man's oxygen levels during rest and exercise.
7. **Referral to a Pulmonologist or Cardiologist**: To further evaluate and manage the man's condition, potentially including additional testing or specialty-specific treatments.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* The man's symptoms and medical history suggest a complex condition that requires further evaluation and testing to determine the underlying cause.
* The fact that the inhaler is not effective and the man's lung capacity is smaller suggests that a more comprehensive approach is needed to manage his symptoms.
* The recommended tests and evaluations will help to rule out potential underlying conditions and guide treatment decisions.
* Specialty referral will provide access to experts in pulmonary and cardiac medicine, who can offer more targeted and effective management of the man's condition.

As for increasing lung capacity, there are several options that may be considered:

1. **Pulmonary Rehabilitation**: A supervised exercise program that can help improve lung function and overall health.
2. **Breathing Exercises**: Techniques such as diaphragmatic breathing, pursed-lip breathing, and yoga breathing exercises may help improve lung function and capacity.
3. **Oxygen Therapy**: Supplemental oxygen may be prescribed to help increase oxygen levels and reduce shortness of breath.
4. **Medications**: Depending on the underlying condition, medications such as bronchodilators, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, or endothelin receptor antagonists may be prescribed to help improve lung function and reduce symptoms.

It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of treatment and management for the man's specific condition."

<built-in function id>,Fainted the other night... should I be worried?,"So background info first: I'm 21 y/o male, 170lbs, athletic and in good shape. No real past medical history.

So the other night I was out drinking with my apartmentmates. We got drunk before we left and went out to a bar. I had one beer while I was there. This was, by no means, a very drunk night for me - I probably had 8 beers over the course of 4 or 5 hours.

At about 2:00, we hit the McDonalds down the block and were planning on going to another place afterwards (bars close at 3am here). I was feeling fine - we each got some McNuggets and as I was eating them, I started feeling a little lightheaded. A couple minutes later, my vision just tunnel vision-ed to black. I stood there for a few seconds, rather alarmed, before I was like ""guys fuck I can't see anything."" Next thing I know, I woke up slumped down against the wall and people were standing around me. I got up and found a seat and we sat down (after a thoughtful ""keep an eye on him"" from the security guard) and we got a cab home and I was fine for the rest of the night. I was really sweaty after it happened but that went away within like 20 mins. 

I have no idea how this happened. I ate breakfast lunch and dinner. I remember everything, except for the 1-2 minutes between when I couldn't see and when I woke up on the floor. The only thing that I could possibly think it could be is dehydration, because I didn't have much to drink all day. But I thought that the dehydration effect of alcohol took a little longer to sink in since I'd had a lot of fluids and my urine wasn't bright yellow or anything. Again, I wasn't that drunk. I've been much more intoxicated, and nothing like this has ever happened.

TLDR: Passed out for seemingly no reason. WebMD seems to think I might have MS, but that seems unlikely so I figured I'd ask.",2,"Based on the symptoms you've described, here are some possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible medical conditions:

1. **Dehydration**: Although you mentioned you had fluids, it's still possible that you were dehydrated, especially considering the diuretic effect of alcohol.
2. **Vasovagal syncope**: This is a common condition where the body overreacts to certain triggers, such as stress, pain, or fatigue, leading to a sudden drop in blood pressure and loss of consciousness.
3. **Orthostatic hypotension**: This condition occurs when the body has trouble adjusting to changes in blood pressure, leading to dizziness or fainting when standing up.
4. **Cardiac arrhythmias**: Abnormal heart rhythms can cause fainting or near-fainting episodes, especially in young, otherwise healthy individuals.
5. **Hypoglycemia**: Low blood sugar can cause dizziness, confusion, and loss of consciousness, especially if you hadn't eaten for a while before the incident.
6. **Seizure disorder**: Although less likely, it's possible that you experienced a seizure, which could have caused the loss of consciousness and tunnel vision.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG)**: To rule out cardiac arrhythmias or other heart-related issues.
2. **Blood tests**: To check for dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and blood sugar levels.
3. **Complete metabolic panel**: To evaluate liver and kidney function, as well as check for any underlying metabolic disorders.
4. **Urinalysis**: To assess hydration status and check for any signs of infection or other underlying conditions.
5. **Neurological examination**: To evaluate for any signs of neurological disorders, such as MS (although, as you mentioned, this is unlikely).
6. **Tilt table test**: To assess for orthostatic hypotension and vasovagal syncope.
7. **Holter monitor**: To monitor heart rhythm over a longer period, if the ECG is normal.
8. **Glucose tolerance test**: To evaluate for hypoglycemia or other glucose-related disorders.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* The ECG and blood tests are standard evaluations to rule out cardiac and metabolic causes of fainting.
* The complete metabolic panel and urinalysis can help identify any underlying conditions that may have contributed to the incident.
* The neurological examination is a precautionary measure to rule out any neurological disorders, although MS is unlikely.
* The tilt table test and Holter monitor can help diagnose orthostatic hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias, respectively.
* The glucose tolerance test can help evaluate for hypoglycemia or other glucose-related disorders.

It's essential to consult a doctor to discuss your symptoms and determine the best course of action. They will likely start with a thorough medical history, physical examination, and some of the above-mentioned tests to rule out any underlying conditions."

Found this bump on my elbow today, looks like a bug bite and I have been out around parks and foresty areas lately, the only thing that concerns me is that when I squish it its softer than most bug bites, like more squishy whereas things like mosquito, fly, and wasp bites are usually kind of hard and painful to touch. Just want to get a second opinion, thanks!",2,"Based on the symptoms described, here are some possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible medical conditions:
1. **Insect bite or sting**: The location and appearance of the bump, along with recent exposure to parks and forested areas, suggest an insect bite or sting.
2. **Folliculitis**: The soft and squishy texture of the bump could indicate an infected hair follicle.
3. **Abscess or boil**: A soft, squishy bump can also be a sign of a localized infection, such as an abscess or boil.
4. **Lipoma or benign cyst**: Although less likely, a soft, squishy bump can also be a benign growth, such as a lipoma or cyst.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:
1. **Physical examination**: A doctor should perform a thorough physical examination to assess the size, shape, color, and texture of the bump, as well as check for any signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, or warmth.
2. **Medical history**: The doctor should ask questions about the patient's medical history, including any previous insect bites or stings, skin conditions, or allergies.
3. **Imaging studies**: If the bump is large or suspicious, the doctor may order imaging studies, such as an ultrasound or MRI, to determine the nature of the bump.
4. **Biopsy or fine-needle aspiration**: If the bump is persistent or growing, a biopsy or fine-needle aspiration may be necessary to rule out any underlying conditions, such as a cyst or tumor.
5. **Culture or sensitivity testing**: If the doctor suspects an infection, they may order culture or sensitivity testing to determine the cause of the infection and guide antibiotic treatment.
6. **Allergy testing**: If the patient has a history of allergies or suspects an allergic reaction to an insect bite or sting, the doctor may recommend allergy testing.

Justifications for these recommendations:
- A physical examination and medical history are essential to gather more information about the bump and the patient's overall health.
- Imaging studies can help determine the nature of the bump and rule out any underlying conditions.
- Biopsy or fine-needle aspiration can provide a definitive diagnosis and guide treatment.

<built-in function id>,Few questions regarding my heart.,"Hey everyone here, thanks for being available!

Basic info:

~130lbs
~Age 21

Okay, so first of all, I've never felt my heart as much as I do now. It is extremely strange and sort of hard to describe.

One symptom is an occasional tightness in the region of my heart. It doesn't last very long, nor does it hurt very much, but it's enough for me to to notice and feel uncomfortable.

Second, sometimes I feel it beating abnormally hard. I was a swimmer in high school, but it has been a while since I have regularly worked out. At this point, it just feels like it is beating too hard for what I am doing. This is seldom, but seems to accompany the tightness.

Third, it feels like it is beating too fast as well. Again, this is not all the time, but enough for me to notice.

I've read up on dehydration possibly causing these symptoms and I am trying to drink more water recently but I'm still feeling these them.

Thanks to all those out there who answer, and if you need any more info feel free to ask. I'd really like to hear some useful information before I decide if I want to go get it checked out.",2,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be considered include:

1. **Anxiety or stress-related disorders**: The symptoms of occasional tightness, abnormal heartbeats, and rapid heart rate could be related to anxiety or stress.
2. **Dehydration**: As mentioned, dehydration can cause symptoms such as rapid heart rate, palpitations, and discomfort in the chest area.
3. **Electrolyte imbalance**: An imbalance of essential electrolytes like potassium, sodium, or magnesium can affect heart function and cause symptoms like palpitations and arrhythmias.
4. **Mitral valve prolapse**: A condition where the mitral valve doesn't close properly, causing symptoms like palpitations, shortness of breath, and chest discomfort.
5. **Arrhythmias**: Abnormal heart rhythms, such as atrial fibrillation or supraventricular tachycardia, can cause symptoms like rapid heart rate, palpitations, and discomfort in the chest area.
6. **Hypertension**: High blood pressure can cause symptoms like palpitations, chest discomfort, and shortness of breath.
7. **Cardiomyopathy**: A disease of the heart muscle that can cause symptoms like palpitations, shortness of breath, and chest discomfort.

To further evaluate these symptoms, a doctor might order the following diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG)**: To assess the heart's electrical activity and detect any abnormalities in the heart rhythm.
2. **Blood tests**: To check for electrolyte imbalances, dehydration, and other potential underlying conditions.
3. **Echocardiogram**: To evaluate the heart's structure and function, including the mitral valve.
4. **Holter monitor**: A 24-hour monitoring device to track the heart's activity and detect any arrhythmias or other abnormalities.
5. **Stress test or exercise stress test**: To evaluate the heart's function under physical stress and detect any potential issues.
6. **Blood pressure monitoring**: To assess blood pressure and detect any potential hypertension.
7. **Physical examination**: A thorough physical examination to assess overall health and detect any potential underlying conditions.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* The ECG and Holter monitor can help detect any arrhythmias or abnormalities in the heart rhythm.
* Blood tests can help identify any underlying conditions, such as electrolyte imbalances or dehydration.
* The echocardiogram can help evaluate the heart's structure and function, including the mitral valve.
* The stress test can help evaluate the heart's function under physical stress and detect any potential issues.

It is essential to consult a doctor to determine the best course of action and to rule out any underlying conditions that may be causing these symptoms."
<built-in function id>,Abdominal pain for months,"I don't have health insurance while not in school and when I was the school doctors were unhelpful. I've had pain in my lower abdomen for several months now and its always been hard to describe. I've had an appendectomy ~4 years ago and the pain is mostly on the left side anyway so I can safely rule that out. In the beginning I suspected a soy protein intolerance or some such thing as the ingredient ""soy protein isolate"" or soy in larger quantities gave me intense discomfort. (I grew up with soy as a replacement for milk as I have anaphilaxis, so the soy problem was new and has not been professionally diagnosed) Since then I've avoided soy but the pain has never really gone away and now it feels like my insides are sore and has been harder to ignore. No amount of poking or prodding (that the doctors did way back when or when I try now) produces any abnormal pain. The pain is generally between the hips and belly button tending towards the left side. I've also noticed difficulty urinating despite the urge to do so. I suspect the answer is ""Go see a real doctor"" but financially this is not really a viable option. I guess I'm looking for a possible diagnosis or steps I can take on my own to ""heal"" what ever this is.",2,"Given your symptoms and medical history, here are some possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible medical conditions:

1. **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)**: The chronic abdominal pain, difficulty describing the pain, and previous suspicion of soy protein intolerance could be indicative of IBS. The fact that you've had an appendectomy and the pain is on the left side reduces the likelihood of appendicitis.
2. **Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)**: Conditions like Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis could cause chronic abdominal pain, difficulty urinating, and soreness in the lower abdomen.
3. **Interstitial Cystitis**: The difficulty urinating despite the urge to do so could be a symptom of interstitial cystitis, a condition that causes bladder pain and discomfort.
4. **Adhesions or scar tissue**: After an appendectomy, adhesions or scar tissue could form, causing chronic pain and discomfort in the lower abdomen.
5. **Hormonal or reproductive issues**: The location of the pain, mostly on the left side, could be related to hormonal or reproductive issues, such as endometriosis, ovarian cysts, or pelvic inflammatory disease.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Keep a symptom journal**: Track your symptoms, including when they occur, how long they last, and any potential triggers. This can help identify patterns and correlations.
2. **Elimination diet**: Try an elimination diet to identify potential food triggers, such as gluten, dairy, or other common allergens.
3. **Urinalysis**: If you can access a low-cost or free clinic, consider getting a urinalysis to check for urinary tract infections or other abnormalities.
4. **Self-examination and tracking**: Continue to monitor your symptoms, and try to identify any potential correlations between your diet, stress levels, and symptom severity.
5. **Seek community resources**: Look into local community clinics, free clinics, or sliding-scale fee clinics that may offer affordable medical care and diagnostic testing.

Justifications:

* Keeping a symptom journal and trying an elimination diet can help you identify potential patterns and triggers, which can inform your next steps.
* A urinalysis can help rule out urinary tract infections or other abnormalities that may be contributing to your symptoms.
* Self-examination and tracking can help you better understand your symptoms and identify potential correlations.
* Seeking community resources can provide access to affordable medical care and diagnostic testing, which may be necessary to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms.

Please note that while these recommendations can be helpful, they are not a substitute for professional medical care. If your symptoms worsen or you experience severe pain, difficulty breathing, or other emergency symptoms, seek immediate medical attention.

In terms of ""healing"" or managing your symptoms, consider the following:

* **Dietary changes**: Avoid trigger foods, and try to incorporate a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
* **Stress management**: Engage in stress-reducing activities, such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises.
* **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water to help manage urinary symptoms and overall health.
* **Exercise**: Regular exercise can help manage stress, improve digestion, and reduce symptoms.

Remember, these are general recommendations, and it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and diagnosis."

Immediately my vein began swelling and you could see that is was bleeding, now it is really bruised about 3 inches all around my wrist. Yesterday (the day after the incident) I got a HORRIBLE headache. I have never had pain like that before, I laid down when I went to bed and was awoken by the pain twice. I took 3 ibuprofen and it did not help at all. The pain was mainly above my eyes and across my forehead. I am wondering if these things are related or if there is any cause for concern... 

Thank you for any help or advice you can give.",2,"Based on the symptoms described, here are possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible medical conditions:

1. **Traumatic injury to the wrist**: The popped vein and subsequent bruising are consistent with a traumatic injury to the wrist.
2. **Headache disorder**: The severe headache that began the day after the incident could be related to the physical exertion or stress of the event.
3. **Migraine**: The location and severity of the headache, particularly the pain above the eyes and across the forehead, could suggest a migraine.
4. **Subarachnoid hemorrhage or other intracranial bleeding**: Although less likely, the severe headache could be a sign of a more serious condition, such as a subarachnoid hemorrhage or other intracranial bleeding, especially if it was triggered by the physical exertion.
5. **Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder**: The headache could be related to TMJ dysfunction, which might have been exacerbated by the physical exertion.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Physical examination**: A doctor should perform a thorough physical examination of the wrist and head to assess for any signs of injury or trauma.
2. **Imaging studies of the wrist**: X-rays or an ultrasound of the wrist may be ordered to rule out any fractures or other injuries.
3. **Imaging studies of the head**: A CT or MRI scan of the head may be ordered to rule out any intracranial bleeding or other abnormalities.
4. **Neurological examination**: A neurological examination should be performed to assess for any signs of neurological deficits or abnormalities.
5. **Blood tests**: Blood tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC) and blood chemistry tests, may be ordered to rule out any underlying conditions that could be contributing to the symptoms.
6. **Referral to a specialist**: Depending on the results of the initial evaluation, the doctor may refer the patient to a specialist, such as a neurologist or an orthopedic specialist, for further evaluation and treatment.

Justifications for each recommendation:

* A physical examination is necessary to assess for any signs of injury or trauma and to determine the extent of the damage to the wrist and head.
* Imaging studies of the wrist and head are necessary to rule out any fractures, intracranial bleeding, or other abnormalities that could be contributing to the symptoms.
* A neurological examination is necessary to assess for any signs of neurological deficits or abnormalities that could be related to the headache or other symptoms.
* Blood tests are necessary to rule out any underlying conditions that could be contributing to the symptoms, such as anemia or infection.
* Referral to a specialist may be necessary to provide further evaluation and treatment, particularly if the symptoms are severe or persistent.

It is essential to seek medical attention as soon as possible, even without insurance, as some conditions may require prompt treatment to prevent further complications. Many hospitals and clinics offer financial assistance or sliding-scale fees for patients without insurance."
<built-in function id>,Do splinters come out on their own?,"I've got a splinter in my finger today in camp, and the medic told me that it should come out on its own after two-three days to one week. Some people thought I should take it out with tweezers after making a cut with a needle, but others insisted it will come out on its own. It's a bit deep in.",2,"Based on the symptoms, possible medical conditions are:

1. **Splinter or foreign body**: The presence of a splinter in the finger is the primary concern.
2. **Infection**: Although not currently present, there is a risk of infection if the splinter is not removed or if it becomes embedded deeper.
3. **Abscess**: A possible complication if the splinter becomes infected and forms a pocket of pus.

Recommended next diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Observation**: The medic's initial advice to wait 2-3 days to one week is reasonable, as the splinter may come out on its own. Monitoring the situation for signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, or increased pain, is essential.
2. **Imaging studies (e.g., X-ray or ultrasound)**: If the splinter is deep or the patient experiences increasing pain, swelling, or signs of infection, imaging studies may be ordered to locate the splinter and assess the extent of the injury.
3. **Wound culture**: If signs of infection develop, a wound culture may be performed to identify the causative organism and guide antibiotic treatment.
4. **Consultation with a specialist (e.g., dermatologist or surgeon)**: If the splinter is large, deep, or causing significant discomfort, or if infection is suspected, a consultation with a specialist may be necessary to discuss removal options.

Justifications:

* Observation is a reasonable initial approach, as many splinters can be naturally expelled by the body.
* Imaging studies can help locate the splinter and assess the extent of the injury, guiding further treatment.
* Wound culture is essential in cases of suspected infection to identify the causative organism and guide antibiotic treatment.
* Consultation with a specialist may be necessary if the splinter is complex or if infection is suspected, as they can provide expert guidance on removal and treatment options.

It is not recommended to attempt to remove the splinter with tweezers or a needle, as this can push the splinter deeper and increase the risk of infection. Instead, following the medic's advice and monitoring the situation for signs of infection or other complications is the best course of action."
<built-in function id>,"My girlfriend has been getting cramps in her calf for over a year now, GPs are no help at all","This will sometimes happen a few times a day, and ill often see her limping due to a bad cramp earlier in the day. theres no particular time it happens, seems to come on totally at random. 

visits to the doctors havent helped at all, the only thing they have done is tested her for diabetes, which she doesnt have.


Shes also an identical twin, her twin doesnt have any such problems.

What could potentially be causing this, and is there anything she can do, other than continuing to pester her GP?",2,"Based on the symptoms described, here are some possible medical conditions that may be causing the cramping and limping:

1. **Muscle strain or overuse**: Random cramping and limping could be due to muscle strain or overuse, especially if the individual is physically active.
2. **Neurological disorders**: Conditions like peripheral neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, or nerve compression could cause muscle cramps and weakness, leading to limping.
3. **Electrolyte imbalance**: Imbalances in electrolytes like potassium, sodium, or calcium can cause muscle cramps, and may be related to underlying conditions like kidney disease or hormonal imbalances.
4. **Vascular disorders**: Poor blood flow or vascular conditions like peripheral artery disease could cause cramping and pain in the legs, leading to limping.
5. **Nutritional deficiencies**: Deficiencies in vitamins like magnesium, vitamin D, or iron could contribute to muscle cramps and weakness.

Given that diabetes has been ruled out, the next diagnostic tests or evaluations a doctor might order could include:

1. **Electromyography (EMG)**: To assess muscle function and detect any underlying neurological disorders.
2. **Nerve conduction studies**: To evaluate nerve function and detect any nerve damage or compression.
3. **Blood tests**: To check for electrolyte imbalances, nutritional deficiencies, and hormonal imbalances.
4. **Imaging studies**: Such as X-rays, MRI, or CT scans to rule out any underlying musculoskeletal or vascular conditions.
5. **Physical therapy evaluation**: To assess muscle strength, flexibility, and range of motion, and to identify any underlying musculoskeletal issues.

As the individual's identical twin does not have similar problems, it's possible that the condition is not solely genetic. However, it's still important to consider genetic factors and potential environmental or lifestyle differences between the twins.

Recommendations for the individual include:

1. **Keep a symptom journal**: To track when the cramping and limping occur, and any potential triggers or patterns.
2. **Stay hydrated and maintain a balanced diet**: To ensure adequate electrolyte and nutrient intake.
3. **Engage in regular exercise**: To maintain muscle strength and flexibility, but avoid overexertion.
4. **Consider consulting a specialist**: Such as a neurologist, physiatrist, or orthopedic specialist, who may be able to provide a more detailed evaluation and diagnosis.
5. **Seek a second opinion**: If the individual is not satisfied with the care they are receiving from their current GP, it may be helpful to seek a second opinion from another healthcare provider."
<built-in function id>,Weird thing with my eyes,"My eyes never change, like if I've been smoking weed, no matter how much, my eyes never change, and pupils never dialate/constrict on painkillers or psychedelics, why? I still feel every other effect of the drugs, also I'm colorblind if that might make a difference.",2,"Based on the symptoms described, here are possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible Medical Conditions:

1. **Adie's Pupil**: A rare neurological disorder characterized by a pupil that does not constrict or dilate in response to light or other stimuli.
2. **Holmes-Adie Syndrome**: A neurological disorder that affects the autonomic nervous system, causing abnormal pupil reactions and other symptoms.
3. **Autonomic Dysfunction**: A condition where the autonomic nervous system, which regulates involuntary functions like pupil dilation and constriction, is impaired.
4. **Congenital or Acquired Anisocoria**: A condition where the pupils are unequal in size, which could be related to the lack of pupil reaction.

Recommended Diagnostic Tests or Evaluations:

1. **Comprehensive Eye Exam**: To rule out any underlying eye conditions that may be contributing to the lack of pupil reaction. This exam would include a thorough evaluation of the eyes, including visual acuity, pupil reaction, and eye movement.
2. **Neurological Examination**: To assess the autonomic nervous system and identify any potential abnormalities. This exam would include tests to evaluate the patient's reflexes, sensation, and motor function.
3. **Pupillometry**: A specialized test to measure the pupil's reaction to light and other stimuli. This test would help determine if the pupil is truly non-reactive.
4. **Autonomic Function Tests**: Such as heart rate variability, blood pressure monitoring, or skin conductance tests to evaluate the autonomic nervous system's function.
5. **Genetic Testing**: To rule out any genetic conditions that may be contributing to the symptoms, such as congenital anisocoria or other inherited disorders.
6. **Toxicology Screening**: To ensure that the patient is not using any substances that could be affecting the pupil's reaction, although the patient reports feeling other effects of the drugs.
7. **Color Vision Testing**: To further evaluate the patient's color vision deficiency and determine if it is related to the lack of pupil reaction.

Justifications:

* The comprehensive eye exam and neurological examination are essential to rule out any underlying conditions that may be contributing to the symptoms.
* Pupillometry and autonomic function tests are necessary to evaluate the pupil's reaction and the autonomic nervous system's function.
* Genetic testing may help identify any underlying genetic conditions that could be contributing to the symptoms.
* Toxicology screening is necessary to ensure that the patient is not using any substances that could be affecting the pupil's reaction.
* Color vision testing may help determine if the color vision deficiency is related to the lack of pupil reaction, although it is unlikely to be directly related.

It is essential to note that a thorough medical evaluation, including a detailed medical history and physical examination, is necessary to determine the underlying cause of the symptoms. A doctor may order additional tests or evaluations based on the patient's specific symptoms and medical history."
<built-in function id>,Stomach pains after taking cold medicine?,"I've been sick for over a week, taking day/nyquil 4 times a day every day. 2 days ago, i started taking muciniex(sp?) and it finally cleared up. Well now today, well it started last night kind of, my stomach has been killing me. Not like i have to shit or vomit, just waves of mild to sometimes intense pain. I had a dream last night (i know, it sounds dumb) and while dreaming, i was having the pains in my dream and they were intense/noticable, and then when i woke up they were unberable. I thought it was just from hunger, so i got up and ate and they didn't go away. Later in the day i made myself throw up because i thought maybe i would feel better, but the pains are still there. I'm just worried that maybe the medicine messed me up somehow? Idk, but should i see a doctor or should i not really worry too much. Im not sure if i have health insurence (im 17) so i don't really want to worry my parents if it's nothing important. Any advice is welcome. ",2,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be considered include:

1. **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**: The stomach pain, especially after eating, could be related to acid reflux.
2. **Gastritis**: The use of over-the-counter medications like DayQuil and NyQuil for an extended period may have irritated the stomach lining, leading to inflammation.
3. **Peptic Ulcer**: The intense stomach pain, especially after eating, could be a sign of a peptic ulcer.
4. **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)**: The abdominal pain, changes in bowel movements, and relief after eating could be indicative of IBS.
5. **Medication-induced stomach issues**: The use of Mucinex and other medications may have caused stomach upset or interacted with other medications.

Recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Physical examination**: A doctor would perform a physical examination to check for any tenderness or abnormalities in the abdominal area.
2. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: A CBC test would help rule out any underlying infections or inflammatory conditions.
3. **Electrolyte panel**: This test would check for any imbalances in electrolytes, which could be related to vomiting or medication use.
4. **Stool test**: A stool test would help diagnose any gastrointestinal infections or conditions.
5. **Upper endoscopy**: If the doctor suspects a peptic ulcer or GERD, an upper endoscopy may be ordered to visualize the upper digestive tract.
6. **Abdominal ultrasound**: This imaging test would help rule out any structural abnormalities or conditions affecting the abdominal organs.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* A physical examination and CBC would help identify any underlying infections or inflammatory conditions.
* An electrolyte panel would check for any imbalances that could be related to vomiting or medication use.
* A stool test would help diagnose any gastrointestinal infections or conditions.
* An upper endoscopy or abdominal ultrasound would provide more detailed information about the upper digestive tract and abdominal organs.

Advice:

* It is essential to consult a doctor to rule out any underlying conditions that may require medical attention.
* As a 17-year-old, it is crucial to discuss health concerns with a parent or guardian, and they can help facilitate a doctor's visit.

At some angles you can not see it but at others it looks like another hole under the anus. It hasn't gone away in a year so I think it is permanently scared like that. It doesnt hurt but I don't want a torn looking anus. Is there anyway they can fix this problem? Where would I go? Could a regular doctor do it???

20 years old
Male",2,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be considered include:

1. **Anal fissure**: A small tear in the lining of the anus, which can cause pain and bleeding. Although the individual mentions it doesn't hurt, the description of the scratch indent and its location under the anus could be related to an anal fissure.
2. **Perianal abscess or fistula**: An abscess or fistula can form in the perianal region, causing a small opening or tunnel under the anus. The fact that the indent expands and contracts could be indicative of an underlying abscess or fistula.
3. **Scar tissue or keloid formation**: The rough handling of the area and subsequent skin removal may have led to the formation of scar tissue or a keloid, which can cause a permanent indentation or lump.

To further evaluate and diagnose the condition, the following diagnostic tests or evaluations may be recommended:

1. **Physical examination**: A thorough physical examination by a healthcare provider, preferably a gastroenterologist or a colorectal surgeon, to assess the area and determine the extent of the damage.
2. **Anoscopy**: A visual examination of the anus and lower rectum using a specialized scope to check for any abnormalities, such as fissures, abscesses, or fistulas.
3. **Ultrasound or MRI**: Imaging studies to evaluate the perianal region and rule out any underlying conditions, such as abscesses or fistulas.

As for treatment, a regular doctor may not be able to provide the necessary expertise to address this issue. It is recommended to consult a:

1. **Gastroenterologist**: A specialist who deals with digestive system disorders, including those related to the anus and rectum.
2. **Colorectal surgeon**: A surgeon who specializes in the treatment of conditions affecting the colon, rectum, and anus.

Treatment options may include:

1. **Topical creams or ointments**: To promote healing and reduce inflammation.
2. **Surgical excision**: To remove any scar tissue or keloid formation.
3. **Fissure or fistula repair**: If an anal fissure or fistula is present, surgical repair may be necessary.

It is essential to consult a specialist to determine the best course of treatment and to rule out any underlying conditions that may require medical attention."

<built-in function id>,Is this reflux or something else?,"Sorry for my bad english, I'm not a native speaker.

When under mental (job interview, school exam) or physical stress (running, demanding workout) I start to retch and have to stop what I am doing and kneel down, shut my eyes and stay immobile to control my breath for 5-15 seconds while it passes away. I never wommit, but feel like I will any second.

It all started when I was in elementary school and realized that sit-ups make me nauseaus. I had no other sympthoms back than right until first year of university where the stress levels were much higher. There 10-30 minutes before exams I started the retching part.

At the age of 30 I gained a lot of weight, I was about 104kg and 185cm tall. I did martial arts, but the above described sympthoms appeart. It was so bad that just sitting in my car seemed to compress my stomach and lungs and I started retching.

At 32 I lost almost 20kgs and all sympthoms wanished. Now I'm back at about 95 and the sympthoms are worse than ever, especially because I had a knee injury last autumn and my conditioning is pretty bad right now.

The problem now is that I also seem to have decreased lung capacity. When I'm out of breath, the retching starts immedietly. I never smoked or drinked alcohol ever and still try my best during trainings, but my condition doesn't improve much.

During wrestling when my upper body is compressed, I immedietly start to panic beacause I'm out of breath. Never had this problem before.

Eating a lot and sugary drinks (especially energy drinks) make the sympthoms appear for sure, don't even have to stress or move a lot.

This could be just reflux or hiatus hernia, but I don't get the usual reflux sympthoms (no heartburn, no pain, no acid taste... maybe the cough part, but I'm not sure).

Is this reflux or something else?",2,"Based on the symptoms described, here are possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible Medical Conditions:

1. **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**: Although the typical symptoms of heartburn and acid taste are not present, the relationship between eating, sugary drinks, and symptom onset suggests a possible connection to reflux.
2. **Hiatal Hernia**: The symptoms of retching, especially when the upper body is compressed, could be related to a hiatal hernia, which can cause reflux-like symptoms.
3. **Anxiety or Panic Disorder**: The panic response during wrestling and the association with stress and mental pressure suggest a possible anxiety or panic disorder component.
4. **Vasovagal Syncope**: The symptoms of retching, nausea, and feeling like vomiting, especially when under physical or mental stress, could be related to a vasovagal response, which can cause a sudden drop in blood pressure and heart rate.
5. **Respiratory issues**: The decreased lung capacity and immediate onset of retching when out of breath suggest a possible respiratory component, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Recommended Diagnostic Tests or Evaluations:

1. **Upper Endoscopy**: To rule out GERD, hiatal hernia, or other esophageal abnormalities, an upper endoscopy can visualize the esophagus and stomach.
2. **Ambulatory pH Monitoring**: This test measures the acidity of the esophagus over a 24-hour period to diagnose GERD or other acid-related disorders.
3. **Barium Swallow**: This imaging test can help diagnose hiatal hernia or other structural abnormalities in the esophagus.
4. **Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs)**: To assess lung capacity and function, PFTs can help diagnose respiratory issues such as asthma or COPD.
5. **Anxiety or Panic Disorder Screening**: A psychological evaluation or screening questionnaire can help determine if anxiety or panic disorder is contributing to the symptoms.
6. **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: To rule out any cardiac abnormalities that could be contributing to the symptoms, an ECG can assess heart rate and rhythm.
7. **Tilt Table Test**: This test can help diagnose vasovagal syncope by monitoring blood pressure and heart rate in response to changes in position.
8. **Lifestyle and Dietary Assessment**: A thorough evaluation of diet, exercise, and stress management habits can help identify potential triggers and contributors to the symptoms.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* The combination of symptoms, including retching, nausea, and decreased lung capacity, suggests a complex interplay between gastrointestinal, respiratory, and psychological factors.
* The absence of typical reflux symptoms, such as heartburn and acid taste, does not rule out GERD or hiatal hernia, as these conditions can present atypically.
* The association between eating, sugary drinks, and symptom onset suggests a possible connection to reflux or other gastrointestinal issues.
* The panic response during wrestling and the relationship between stress and symptom onset suggest a possible anxiety or panic disorder component.
* The decreased lung capacity and immediate onset of retching when out of breath suggest a possible respiratory component."
<built-in function id>,So.... should I do call ahead seating for a liver transplant or...?,"I've been reading about tylenol being dangerous if more than 4000mg is taken in a day and now I really need to know if I'm killing my liver. I have a ton of surgical rods and screws in my back from scoliosis correction and also have severe fibromyalgia. To help relieve pain I take tramadol, cymbalta, and of course tylenol. 

I take 3900 mg of tylenol pretty much every day, sometimes more if I need to take a 3rd dose. I generally take 3 650mg tablets first thing in the morning and again late in the afternoon or at bedtime. Sometimes I wind up taking 3 doses in a day when I'm busy going all day or if I'm having a really painful day which would bring me up to a total of 5850mg in 24 hrs. 

I know I should probably take less but this is what I've had to do to function somewhat normally, and honestly I barely get by. 

So.... call ahead seating for a liver transplant?",2,"Based on the symptoms and medication usage described, possible medical conditions that may be relevant include:

1. **Liver damage or toxicity**: The high daily dosage of Tylenol (3900-5850mg) exceeds the recommended limit, increasing the risk of liver damage.
2. **Fibromyalgia**: The patient already has a diagnosis of severe fibromyalgia, which may be contributing to their chronic pain.
3. **Scoliosis and chronic pain**: The patient's history of scoliosis correction and presence of surgical rods and screws may be contributing to their chronic pain.
4. **Medication overuse or dependence**: The patient's reliance on multiple pain medications, including tramadol, Cymbalta, and Tylenol, may indicate medication overuse or dependence.

Recommended next diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Liver function tests (LFTs)**: To assess liver damage or toxicity, the doctor may order LFTs, including alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and bilirubin levels.
2. **Complete blood count (CBC)**: To evaluate overall health and detect any potential bleeding disorders or anemia.
3. **Imaging studies (e.g., ultrasound or CT scan)**: To assess liver morphology and detect any potential liver damage or disease.
4. **Pain management evaluation**: A comprehensive pain management evaluation to assess the patient's current pain regimen and explore alternative treatment options to reduce Tylenol usage.
5. **Medication review and adjustment**: A review of the patient's medication list to identify potential interactions or duplicate therapies, and adjust the regimen to minimize liver risk and optimize pain management.
6. **Fibromyalgia management**: A re-evaluation of the patient's fibromyalgia treatment plan to explore alternative therapies, such as physical therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, or other medications, to reduce reliance on Tylenol.
7. **Referral to a pain management specialist or hepatologist**: To provide specialized care and guidance on managing chronic pain and potential liver damage.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* The patient's high Tylenol usage increases the risk of liver damage, making LFTs and imaging studies essential for assessing liver health.
* A comprehensive pain management evaluation can help identify alternative treatment options to reduce Tylenol usage and minimize liver risk.
* A medication review and adjustment can help optimize the patient's pain regimen and reduce potential interactions or duplicate therapies.
* Referral to a specialist can provide the patient with access to specialized care and guidance on managing chronic pain and potential liver damage.

As for ""call ahead seating for a liver transplant,"" it's unlikely that the patient would require a liver transplant at this point. However, it's essential to take proactive steps to assess and manage potential liver damage to prevent long-term consequences."
<built-in function id>,Tonsil Problems,"Sore throat developed 02/12/2014. Initially was one-sided, suspecting it to be gland pain because I felt it in my neck. Two days after, lots of exudate in both tonsils - had to drain it off just to swallow somewhat comfortably. Today, Im at the point I can barely swallow again. Cant see exudate superficially, but I can ""inside"" if that makes sense. Also developed abscess-looking lesions next to my tonsils, albeit small. No fever... yet anyways. 

I definitely plan on seeking professional help for this, but Im wondering if I should wait till the clinic opens on Tuesday, go to the ED, or maybe even go out of town to see if a walk-in clinic is open in the morning?

20 y/o F, wisdom teeth removed one month ago, no current meds but had penicillin VK and percocet for the surgery. Have had about 10 or so similar episodes within the past 6 months. Some of these tested positive for strep (medicated accordingly) while others did not. I asked about seeing an ENT, but clinic said that was a little over the top. Havent sought treatment for about half of these because the practitioners make it seem like its not worth the time. What do I need to ask or say to get the most out of my appointment?",2,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions include:

1. **Recurrent tonsillitis**: Given the frequent episodes of sore throat and tonsillar exudate, this is a likely diagnosis.
2. **Peritonsillar abscess**: The abscess-looking lesions next to the tonsils and difficulty swallowing suggest this possibility.
3. **Strep throat**: Although some previous episodes tested positive for strep, it's still a potential cause, especially with the presence of exudate and sore throat.
4. **Tonsillar cellulitis**: The inflammation and exudate around the tonsils could indicate this condition.

Recommended next diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Throat swab culture**: To check for strep throat or other bacterial infections.
2. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: To evaluate for signs of infection or inflammation.
3. **Imaging studies (e.g., CT or MRI)**: To assess for peritonsillar abscess or other complications.
4. **ENT referral**: Given the recurrent nature of the symptoms, an ENT specialist may be able to provide a more comprehensive evaluation and recommend further testing or treatment.

As for seeking medical attention, considering the severity of symptoms (difficulty swallowing and potential abscess), it's recommended to:

1. **Visit the ED or an urgent care center**: If the symptoms worsen or if there's significant difficulty swallowing, seek immediate attention.
2. **Schedule an appointment with a primary care physician**: If the symptoms are manageable, schedule an appointment for Tuesday, but be prepared to provide detailed information about the symptoms and medical history.

To get the most out of the appointment, consider asking or saying:

1. **""I've had multiple episodes of similar symptoms in the past 6 months, and I'm concerned about the underlying cause. Can we discuss possible reasons for these recurrent infections?""**: This shows that you're proactive and concerned about your health.
2. **""I've been told that my symptoms are not worth treating in the past, but I'm experiencing significant discomfort and difficulty swallowing. Can we explore further testing or treatment options?""**: This conveys your frustration and desire for a more comprehensive evaluation.
3. **""I'm interested in seeing an ENT specialist. Can you refer me or provide guidance on how to proceed?""**: This demonstrates your willingness to seek specialized care and may help facilitate a referral.
4. **""What are the potential risks or complications of not treating my symptoms, and what are the benefits of further evaluation or treatment?""**: This shows that you're interested in understanding the potential consequences of not seeking treatment and the benefits of further care.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* Recurrent tonsillitis and peritonsillar abscess are potential complications of untreated or undertreated tonsillar infections.
* Strep throat and tonsillar cellulitis require prompt treatment to prevent further complications.
* An ENT specialist can provide a more comprehensive evaluation and recommend further testing or treatment, such as tonsillectomy or other procedures.
* Seeking immediate attention at the ED or urgent care center can help prevent potential complications, such as airway obstruction or abscess rupture.
* Providing detailed information about symptoms and medical history can help the healthcare provider make a more accurate diagnosis and develop an effective treatment plan."
<built-in function id>,Heart failure?,"It's probably unlikely that I have heart failure (18 y/o), but I think I'm feeling short of breath when on my bed (actually it feels like more like a tight or heavy sensation in my throat/upper chest and kinda like I need to cough). I've felt this for 4 days now and it's worse at night. I have pretty bad anxiety over my heart and I'm constantly worrying about it.

Doing some tests at home my BP was measured at 122/80 and capillary refill is under 1 second when pressing on my toe nail. Resting heart rate is 55-70 BPM and there's usually no irregularities with the beat, but it does speed up/down sometimes weirdly and I get palpitations on occasion.

Looking online, these results seem to be pretty much perfect. But is it possible that some people with heart failure can get good results like mine, or would they get far worse results?",2,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be considered include:

1. **Anxiety-related disorders**: The constant worrying about heart health and anxiety over heart conditions may be contributing to the symptoms of shortness of breath and tightness in the throat/upper chest.
2. **Hyperventilation syndrome**: The feeling of needing to cough and the sensation of tightness in the throat/upper chest could be related to hyperventilation, which is often associated with anxiety.
3. **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**: The symptoms of tightness in the throat/upper chest and the worsening of symptoms at night could be related to GERD, which can cause discomfort and tightness in the chest and throat.
4. **Asthma or other respiratory conditions**: Although less likely, it's possible that the symptoms could be related to an underlying respiratory condition such as asthma.

As for the possibility of heart failure with good test results, it's highly unlikely that a 18-year-old with heart failure would have perfect test results like the ones described. Heart failure typically presents with more pronounced symptoms such as significant shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling, and abnormal heart rhythms. Additionally, heart failure would likely be associated with abnormal blood pressure, heart rate, and capillary refill results.

Recommended next diagnostic tests or evaluations:

<built-in function id>,Sore throat: Bacteria or virus,"How can I tell if I have a viral infection or a bacterial infection, especially if I don't have tonsils?  

My throat is increasingly sore, and when I use a light to see in my throat, my whole throat is red.  There is no telltale whiteness anywhere, but the back of my throat isn't smooth either - it has relatively pale raised areas arranged in superior-inferior- running lines especially down each side of my throat.  The pain is localized to naso- and oro-pharynx.  My voice is not suffering, but swallowing really hurts.  I just want to be able to rule out bacterial infection so I don't waste time at the doctor. Can you guys help?

I'm on tylenol for pain, and no other meds.  Female, 30s, normal weight.

Thanks for any advice.",2,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be considered include:

1. **Viral pharyngitis**: The sore throat, redness, and pale raised areas in the throat are consistent with a viral infection, which is often self-limiting and may not require antibiotics.
2. **Bacterial pharyngitis**: Although there is no visible white discharge, bacterial infections like strep throat can still occur, especially if the symptoms are severe or persistent.
3. **Infectious mononucleosis**: The pale raised areas in the throat could be indicative of infectious mononucleosis, also known as mono or glandular fever, which is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus.
4. **Acute tonsillitis**: Although the patient does not have tonsils, the surrounding tissue can still become inflamed and cause symptoms similar to tonsillitis.

To determine the cause of the symptoms and rule out a bacterial infection, the following diagnostic tests or evaluations may be recommended:

1. **Rapid strep test**: A rapid strep test can help diagnose strep throat, a bacterial infection caused by Group A Streptococcus. This test involves swabbing the throat and can provide results within minutes.
2. **Throat culture**: A throat culture can help identify the presence of bacteria or other microorganisms in the throat. This test involves swabbing the throat and sending the sample to a laboratory for analysis.
3. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: A CBC can help identify signs of infection, such as an elevated white blood cell count, which can indicate a bacterial or viral infection.
4. **Mononucleosis spot test**: If infectious mononucleosis is suspected, a mononucleosis spot test can help diagnose the condition.
5. **Physical examination**: A physical examination by a healthcare provider can help assess the severity of the symptoms and look for other signs of infection, such as swollen lymph nodes or a fever.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* The rapid strep test and throat culture can help diagnose bacterial infections, such as strep throat, which require antibiotic treatment.
* The CBC can help identify signs of infection and guide further testing or treatment.
* The mononucleosis spot test can help diagnose infectious mononucleosis, which can have similar symptoms to viral or bacterial pharyngitis.
* A physical examination can help assess the severity of the symptoms and guide further testing or treatment.

It is essential to consult a healthcare provider for a proper evaluation and diagnosis, as they can assess the symptoms and medical history to determine the best course of action."
<built-in function id>,"Strep Throat, Skipping Antibiotics","Hi guys. I'ev been diagnosed with strep throat. But I really really don't want to take the antibiotics. They reek havoc on your body and kill off all of the good bacteria. Apparently even after one course of antibiotics, 6 months later, your microbiome is still in recovery. Is this a foolish idea? Is the risk of rheumatic fever greater than the damage that will be caused by the antibiotics? What sort of odds am I dealing with here? Thanks.

Age 22
Sex M
Height 5""11
Weight 155lbs
Location Australia",2,"Based on the symptoms and concerns, here are possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

**Possible Medical Conditions:**

1. **Strep Throat (already diagnosed)**: The patient has been diagnosed with strep throat, which is a bacterial infection caused by Group A Streptococcus.
2. **Rheumatic Fever**: This is a potential complication of untreated strep throat, which can lead to inflammation of the heart, joints, and nervous system.
3. **Guttate Psoriasis**: This is a skin condition that can be triggered by strep throat, especially in young adults.
4. **Glomerulonephritis**: This is a kidney disease that can be caused by untreated strep throat, leading to inflammation of the kidneys.

**Recommended Diagnostic Tests or Evaluations:**

<built-in function id>,Bad reaction to bp meds,"30 f have been on atenolol 25 mg for bp since i was 20. Was put on lisinopril for a short time, but had to come off of it due to getting heart palpitations. Recently me and my husband are trying for a baby so the doctor decided to try me on 100 mg of labeterol 2 times a day.  Ive been on that for a few days and yesterday my bp spiked to 133/98 and pulse at 100. I felt like i was going to pass out, shaky, and headache. I call my doctor and was told to either wait it out or go back on my atenolol.  The whole reason to go off of the atenolol was because it is a betta blocker and not the best thing to be on when pregnant.  This morning bp at 130/102 and pulse 83. 

I did try and go off bp meds over the summer with doctors care and had a similar reaction. Racing pulse and bp.  Just not sure if there is something else to try.  Not so happy with my  docs response. Any advice is greatly appreciated. :-)",2,"Based on the symptoms you've described, here are some possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

Possible medical conditions:

1. **Hypertension**: Your blood pressure readings are elevated, which is a concern, especially since you're trying to conceive.

<built-in function id>,"[serious] A friend's son was diagnosed with Diffuse Pontine Glioma, have any of you heard of alternative treatment options that work?","Diffuse Pontine Glomma, as I understand it, does not have a mainstream treatment that seem very promising. I've heard of a cannabis extract that is supposedly helpful for this particular tumor. We do not live in a state that allows medical marijuana, so it seems difficult to find a lot of information on those treatment options. We have also heard of an organic medicine made from muscadine grapes. Being that there is such a low survival rate and there are little treatment options, we are looking for any information and opinions available. I'm personally a fan of the reddit layout and told him I would ask these questions here. ",2,"Based on the symptoms described, specifically Diffuse Pontine Glioma (DIPG), here are possible medical conditions and recommended diagnostic tests or evaluations:

**Possible Medical Conditions:**

1. **Diffuse Pontine Glioma (DIPG)**: A rare and aggressive brain tumor that originates in the pons, a part of the brainstem.
2. **Brainstem Glioma**: A broader category of brain tumors that occur in the brainstem, including DIPG.
3. **Pontine Tumor**: A tumor that occurs in the pons, which may be benign or malignant.

**Recommended Diagnostic Tests or Evaluations:**

1. **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) of the Brain**: To confirm the diagnosis of DIPG and assess the tumor's size, location, and extent of spread.
2. **CT (Computed Tomography) Scan of the Brain**: To further evaluate the tumor and rule out other potential causes of symptoms.
3. **Biopsy**: A surgical procedure to collect a tissue sample from the tumor for histopathological examination, which can help confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.
4. **Lumbar Puncture (LP)**: To collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for analysis, which can help detect tumor cells or other abnormalities.
5. **Neurological Examination**: A thorough evaluation of the patient's neurological function, including cognitive, motor, and sensory assessments.
6. **Genetic Testing**: To identify potential genetic mutations that may be associated with DIPG, such as H3F3A or ACVR1 mutations.

Regarding the use of cannabis extract and muscadine grape-based organic medicine, while these alternatives may be of interest, it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional before pursuing any unconventional treatments. The effectiveness and safety of these treatments for DIPG are not well established, and more research is needed to fully understand their potential benefits and risks.

**Justifications:**

* MRI and CT scans are essential for diagnosing and evaluating the extent of DIPG.
* Biopsy and LP can provide valuable information about the tumor's histology and potential spread.
* Neurological examination can help assess the patient's functional status and guide treatment decisions.
* Genetic testing may help identify potential targets for therapy or provide insight into the tumor's biology.

**Additional Recommendations:**

1. Consult with a pediatric neuro-oncologist or a specialist in brain tumors to discuss treatment options and potential clinical trials.
2. Explore palliative care options to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.
3. Consider seeking a second opinion at a reputable cancer center or hospital with experience in treating DIPG.

Keep in mind that DIPG is a rare and aggressive disease, and treatment options are limited. While unconventional treatments may be of interest, it is crucial to prioritize evidence-based medicine and consult with healthcare professionals to ensure the best possible outcomes."
<built-in function id>,"Random chest pain, two occurrences in past year","Medical background: Healthy, if out of shape(but not overweight) 20-year-old. Occasional alcohol use and cigar smoking(once or twice a month for both), used to smoke marijuana. Family history on my mothers side of heart disease, heart attacks in both grandparents on that side and my grandpa died of it when he was in his 50s or 60 or something, though my grandma lived to the ripe old age of 93, finally succumbing to cancer.

I'm currently in Health 101, and was reading the chapter on cardiovascular disease. The section on angina reminded me of two occurrences in chest pain over the past year, and since I have the family history of heart problems, figured I should pay attention to that more then I have been.

The first time, back in June, I was just sitting in a work training session, taking notes, and I got a pain in my chest. It was most painful when I inhaled, the more full my lungs were the more painful it was. I took shallower breaths, didn't say anything, and it went away in about ten minutes.

The second time, just a couple weeks ago, I had the same pain upon waking up. I was laying down, and getting up made it hurt more, as did taking deep breaths, so I just took shallow breaths and the pain subsided within 5 or 10 minutes.

Does any doctor know what this possibly could be? Is it a lung issue or a heart issue? And are these symptoms serious enough that I should see a doctor?",2,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be considered include:

1. **Costochondritis**: An inflammation of the cartilage that connects the ribs to the breastbone, which can cause chest pain that worsens with deep breathing or movement.
2. **Precordial catch syndrome**: A condition that causes sharp, stabbing chest pain, often triggered by deep breathing or movement, and can be related to the muscles or nerves in the chest wall.
3. **Pulmonary embolism**: A blood clot in the lungs, which can cause chest pain that worsens with deep breathing, although this is less likely given the intermittent and self-resolving nature of the symptoms.
4. **Pericarditis**: An inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart, which can cause chest pain that worsens with deep breathing or movement.
5. **Anxiety or panic disorder**: Chest pain can be a symptom of anxiety or panic attacks, especially if the pain is triggered by stress or emotional factors.
6. **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**: Stomach acid reflux can cause chest pain, especially if it occurs at night or is triggered by certain foods.
7. **Cardiac issues**: Although less likely given the patient's age and lack of other symptoms, cardiac conditions such as myocardial bridging or coronary artery anomalies cannot be entirely ruled out, especially with a family history of heart disease.

To further evaluate these symptoms, a doctor might order the following diagnostic tests or evaluations:

1. **Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG)**: To assess the heart's electrical activity and rule out any cardiac abnormalities.
2. **Chest X-ray**: To evaluate the lungs and chest cavity for any signs of infection, inflammation, or other abnormalities.
3. **Complete blood count (CBC) and blood chemistry tests**: To rule out any underlying infections, inflammatory conditions, or other systemic diseases.
4. **Echocardiogram**: To evaluate the heart's structure and function, including the valves, chambers, and blood flow.
5. **Stress test or treadmill test**: To assess the heart's response to physical activity and rule out any cardiac ischemia or arrhythmias.
6. **Lung function tests (spirometry or pulmonary function tests)**: To evaluate lung function and rule out any respiratory conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
7. **Upper endoscopy or gastroscopy**: To evaluate the esophagus and stomach for any signs of GERD or other gastrointestinal conditions.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* The symptoms of chest pain, especially with deep breathing or movement, warrant further evaluation to rule out any cardiac or pulmonary conditions.
* The family history of heart disease increases the likelihood of cardiac issues, although the patient's age and lack of other symptoms make this less likely.
* The intermittent and self-resolving nature of the symptoms suggests a non-life-threatening condition, but further evaluation is still necessary to determine the underlying cause.
* A thorough medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests will help to narrow down the possible causes and guide further management.

It is recommended that the patient sees a doctor for a thorough evaluation, as the symptoms could be related to a variety of conditions, some of which may require prompt attention."

I went from 230 to 182lbs in 4 weeks. I saw my doctor twice during the 4 week span, it worried her at the time.

5 years ago I had these red painful bumps appear on my left neck, it is still there and painful once a month. 3 years ago a pilonidal cyst appeared.

I haven't actually seen any doctor since the stint 7 years ago. The reason is my fear of needles. 

My last visit she asked for a blood sample, I went fully knowing I would pass out like every other time. However this time just before i passed out i felt an extreme pain in my chest, honestly the only way i can describe it was when my lung collapsed after falling off a hill, when i awoke i had doctors standing all around me. My heart had stopped. They were freaking out, they put me on some kind of monitor and what not. They made a note to my doctor, but i never returned.

I had to have a filling done a year after that incident, i warned them i would pass out. That same painful feeling happened, and when i came to they were on the phone with 911 and freaking out. They said they couldn't feel a pulse, on staff nurse did cpr and called 911.

I need help, and i don't know where else to go. I don't fear death, but i certainly wouldn't want another person to think they caused my passing.

I think it is just bloody mucus but she is very concerned about it so I figured I would ask you guys. I actually have a picture of it taken right after it was pulled out if that is necessary I can post it.",2,"Based on the symptoms described, possible medical conditions that may be considered include:

1. **Nasal polyp**: A growth that can cause bleeding and may be visible as a ""hanging"" structure.
2. **Nasal tumor**: A benign or malignant growth that can cause bleeding and may be visible as a mass.
3. **Foreign body**: An object that has been lodged in the nose, causing bleeding and discomfort.
4. **Nasal dryness or irritation**: Dry air, allergies, or other irritants can cause bleeding and discomfort in the nose.
5. **Nasal septal perforation**: A hole in the thin wall of cartilage and bone that separates the two sides of the nose, which can cause bleeding.

2. **Imaging studies**: A CT or MRI scan may be ordered to evaluate the nasal passages and sinuses for any underlying conditions, such as tumors or structural abnormalities.
3. **Biopsy**: If a mass or growth is suspected, a biopsy may be performed to determine if it is benign or malignant.
4. **Allergy testing**: If allergies are suspected to be contributing to the nasal irritation, allergy testing may be recommended.
5. **Nasal smear or culture**: A sample of nasal secretions may be taken to check for infections or other conditions.

Justifications for these recommendations:

* Nasal endoscopy and imaging studies can help identify any visible abnormalities or underlying conditions that may be causing the bleeding.
* Biopsy is necessary to determine the nature of any mass or growth that is found.
* Allergy testing can help identify any underlying allergies that may be contributing to the nasal irritation.
* Nasal smear or culture can help identify any infections or other conditions that may be contributing to the symptoms.

It's unlikely that the ""long bloody looking thing"" is just bloody mucus, as mucus is typically not solid or stringy. It's possible that it's a nasal polyp or other growth that has been dislodged.
