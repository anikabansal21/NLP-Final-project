<built-in function id>,Throbbing head pain in various situations,"Basically the only thing wrong with me is that I get head pain whenever I stand up or when I sneeze, clench my teeth, or anything else similar. I suspected high blood pressure but I went to the doctor and it was 120/75. The doctor suggested it was from overexertion because I was on vacation in the New England area and did a lot of walking which I'm not used to and possibly a cold virus as well. I was told to take normal doses of Advil, which I did. I was also told it should be gone in a couple of days, but that time has elapsed and it has actually gotten worse when the Advil wears off. Any thoughts?",6,"**Verified Physician here**

I'd like to offer some additional insights, but please keep in mind that this is not a substitute for an in-person evaluation. It's great that you've already seen a doctor and had your blood pressure checked, which seems to be within a normal range.

The symptoms you're describing, particularly the worsening of head pain with standing, sneezing, or straining, could be suggestive of a few different conditions. One possibility is a spinal headache or a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, although this is relatively rare. Another possibility is a condition called intracranial hypotension, which can cause headaches that worsen with standing or straining.

I'm concerned that the Advil hasn't provided sufficient relief and that the symptoms have worsened over time. I would recommend following up with your doctor to discuss further evaluation and potential referral to a specialist, such as a neurologist.

In the meantime, I would advise against continuing to take Advil regularly, as this can lead to rebound headaches and other complications. Instead, you may want to consider alternative over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen, and focus on staying hydrated and managing your stress levels.

It's also important to note that a cold virus or overexertion could be contributing factors, but it's unlikely that these would be the sole cause of your symptoms, especially given their persistence and worsening over time.

Please do follow up with your doctor and consider seeking a second opinion if your symptoms continue to worsen or persist. **Edit:** I'll add that if you experience any severe or sudden worsening of symptoms, such as confusion, weakness, or difficulty speaking, you should seek immediate medical attention."
<built-in function id>,Father has swollen lymph nodes in his groin area.,According to [WebMD](http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/swollen-lymph-nodes-topic-overview) this may be due to melanoma. If my father has an irregular mole on his cheek and back could the swollen lymph nodes be a result of melanoma?,4,"**u/DermDoc123 (Verified Physician)**: I'd be happy to help clarify things for you. While it's understandable to be concerned about melanoma, especially with irregular moles present, it's essential to consider the entire clinical picture. Swollen lymph nodes can be caused by a multitude of factors, including infections, autoimmune disorders, and yes, malignancies like melanoma.

That being said, the presence of irregular moles and swollen lymph nodes doesn't necessarily mean your father has melanoma. A thorough evaluation by a dermatologist or a primary care physician is crucial to determine the cause of the swollen lymph nodes. They will likely perform a physical exam, take a detailed history, and may order imaging studies or a biopsy to rule out other potential causes.

It's also important to note that melanoma typically spreads to lymph nodes in a more predictable pattern, often involving the lymph nodes closest to the primary tumor site. If your father's moles are on his cheek and back, you'd expect to see lymph node enlargement in the neck or axilla (armpit), respectively.

I strongly encourage your father to schedule an appointment with a dermatologist or his primary care physician to get a proper evaluation and diagnosis. In the meantime, try not to jump to conclusions or rely solely on WebMD (as helpful as it can be) for a diagnosis. A healthcare professional can provide a much more accurate assessment and guide the next steps in management. **Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns!**"
<built-in function id>,Should I continue on my antibiotics?,"I was prescribed antibiotics for a 10 day period because I possibly had strep throat. Today the results came back negative for strep, and I'm 3 days into the antibiotics. I want to drink this weekend but immediately after taking the antibiotics I felt better. I'm wondering if I should stop taking them I have two options:
1) I stop because I have a virus and only felt better after antibiotics as a coincidence
2) I continue taking them because maybe I have some other bacteria and the antibiotics are actually working

My cousin who's a nurse said I should continue for a few more days, but I'm not sure, help?",4,"**Verified Physician here**

I'd advise against stopping the antibiotics abruptly, despite the negative strep test. Here's why:

Even though the strep test came back negative, it's possible that you have another bacterial infection that's responding to the antibiotics. Stopping the course prematurely could lead to the infection not being fully cleared, which might result in a relapse or even complications like abscesses or sinus infections.

It's also important to note that antibiotics can sometimes provide symptom relief due to their anti-inflammatory properties, which might be why you felt better soon after starting them. However, this doesn't necessarily mean the underlying infection has been fully treated.

I'd recommend continuing the antibiotics as prescribed by your doctor, even if it means postponing your drinking plans for a few more days. Completing the full course will ensure that any potential bacterial infection is fully treated, and reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance.

Your cousin's advice to continue for a few more days is sound, but I'd suggest finishing the entire 10-day course as prescribed. If you have concerns or questions, it's always best to consult with your prescribing doctor or a qualified healthcare professional.

**Edit:** To clarify, I'm not saying you definitely have a bacterial infection, but rather that it's possible and that completing the antibiotic course is the safest approach. If you're still unsure, consider discussing your concerns with your doctor or a healthcare professional."
<built-in function id>,Do these symptoms mean I should get a colonoscopy?,"My question is about the necessity of a colonoscopy and the sensible timeline for getting one.

I'm 24 and have been having bowel disturbances for about five months -- frequent (at least 4-6 times/day) bowel movements, bloating and gas every evening, and about once a month or two some light rectal bleeding. Besides bloating dull ache, I feel occasional sharp pain in my lower left abdomen. 

Have done tests to rule out common viral/bacterial infections and ulcerative colitis and tried IBS medicine for a month (not much help). 

Saw bowel specialist who is having me get some blood work and another pathogen test done. He recommended a colonoscopy to check for inflammation.

Now, I'm from the US but currently work in New Zealand and would have to pay for the colonoscopy (about $1500-2000) out of pocket if I get it done here. If I wait until I come home in December, my US insurance would probably cover it.

I'm hoping for advice on any danger there could be in waiting. I guess I've gotten used to the symptoms and have found that changing my diet alleviates them a bit. If symptoms go away, would it be a bad idea to forego a colonoscopy all together?

I've read stories about younger people getting bowel cancer and having it go undetected because it's seen as a disease older people get, so that's in the back of my mind.

Complicating or perhaps explaining all this, I was on two courses of antibiotics for unrelated infections during the last four months and three other courses in the past year....and I have had severe food allergies all my life to dairy, nuts and shellfish. When I was younger I had minor allergies to wheat and soy.

I cut soy and wheat out of my diet in the past week and have found some symptoms have improved a bit.





",3,"**Verified Physician here**

I'd like to offer some advice on your situation. First, I must commend you on taking proactive steps to manage your symptoms and exploring potential underlying causes. Given your symptoms of frequent bowel movements, bloating, gas, and occasional rectal bleeding, it's reasonable to consider a colonoscopy to rule out inflammatory or structural issues.

While it's understandable that you're hesitant to pay out-of-pocket for the procedure in New Zealand, I would caution against delaying the colonoscopy until December. Although your symptoms may have improved slightly with dietary changes, the presence of rectal bleeding and sharp abdominal pain warrants further investigation.

As you've mentioned, bowel cancer can occur in younger individuals, and it's essential to rule out this possibility. Additionally, your history of antibiotic use and severe food allergies may contribute to an increased risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or other gastrointestinal conditions.

Delaying the colonoscopy may lead to a few potential risks:

1. **Progression of underlying disease**: If you have an underlying condition like IBD or a structural issue, delaying diagnosis and treatment may allow the disease to progress, potentially leading to more severe symptoms, complications, or even increased risk of cancer.
2. **Masking of symptoms**: Your dietary changes may be masking underlying symptoms, which could lead to a false sense of security. It's essential to investigate the cause of your symptoms rather than just managing them.
3. **Increased risk of complications**: If you have an underlying condition, delaying treatment may increase the risk of complications, such as bowel obstruction, abscesses, or perforation.

Regarding your question about forgoing the colonoscopy if your symptoms improve, I would advise against it. Even if your symptoms resolve, it's crucial to investigate the underlying cause to ensure that you don't have a more serious condition that requires treatment.

I would recommend discussing your concerns with your bowel specialist and exploring options for reducing the out-of-pocket cost of the colonoscopy in New Zealand. Some potential alternatives could include:

1. **Seeking financial assistance**: You may be eligible for financial assistance programs or discounts through the hospital or clinic.
2. **Negotiating with the provider**: Your specialist may be able to negotiate a reduced rate or payment plan with the hospital or clinic.
3. **Considering a different provider**: You may be able to find a more affordable option through a different provider or clinic.

In summary, while it's understandable to consider the cost, I would strongly advise against delaying the colonoscopy. The potential risks and consequences of delaying diagnosis and treatment outweigh the costs. I recommend discussing your concerns with your specialist and exploring options for reducing the out-of-pocket cost.

**Edit:** I'd like to add that if you're experiencing severe symptoms or significant rectal bleeding, you should seek immediate medical attention. However, based on your description, it seems that your symptoms are manageable, and you're looking for guidance on the best course of action."
<built-in function id>,Thought I was going to die yesterday.,"I (33 M) was standing in the kitchen yesterday when a wave of dizziness, high bp and heart rate came over me. I couldn't stand, and basically fell to he floor. My wife called an ambulance right away. Lying on the floor, I remained conscious, but really dizzy and I thought I might pass out at any moment. There was a persistent tingling in both my hands. I was scared for my life at this time.

The EMT's came and took my pressure. It was at 163/120 and my rate was at 123 (if I remember correctly). I was taken to hospital, and there I had to wait for 7 hours before seeing a doctor. All this time I felt dizzy, and sometimes it came in stronger. 

They did a complete bloodwork, urine, ecg, and a chest x-ray. Everything was normal there, well as normal as you'd expect from a smoker who drinks a bit more than average. 

I was discharged, went home and slept. Right now I feel a bit weak. I feel a lot better then yesterday, but a little light-headed and weak.

I got to thinking that my anxiety may have been a factor here, but I am no doctor, so that's why I am writing this.

What I am hoping for is a possible explanation for what happened, because when my tests came back negative, it left me a bit nervous.

If any additional info is needed, I'll provide through a PM.",3,"**Verified Physician here**

I'm glad to hear that you're feeling a bit better today. I'll try to provide some insight into what might have happened, but please keep in mind that I'm not your treating physician and this is not a substitute for a thorough evaluation.

Based on your symptoms, it's possible that you experienced a vasovagal episode, which can be triggered by anxiety, stress, or even a sudden change in position (like standing up quickly). The high blood pressure and heart rate you mentioned are consistent with this diagnosis. The tingling in your hands could be related to a temporary decrease in blood flow or a nervous system response.

It's also possible that you might have had a panic attack, which can present with similar symptoms, including dizziness, palpitations, and tingling sensations. Anxiety can indeed play a significant role in triggering these episodes.

The fact that your tests came back normal is reassuring, but it's not uncommon for vasovagal episodes or panic attacks to not show up on routine tests. It's possible that your doctor might have considered other diagnoses, such as orthostatic hypotension or a cardiac issue, but the normal ECG and chest X-ray make these less likely.

I would recommend following up with your primary care physician to discuss your symptoms and test results in more detail. They may want to consider ordering additional tests, such as a Holter monitor or an echocardiogram, to rule out any underlying cardiac issues.

In the meantime, it's essential to manage your anxiety and stress levels. Consider practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga, and try to reduce your smoking and alcohol intake.

If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to PM me, and I'll do my best to help.

<built-in function id>,Daughter is teething and I don't know what this is.,"[Tooth](http://imgur.com/FNgqsaX) in question. Wife sent me this picture of our daughter saying she thinks the little pointed tip is a nerve, making an dentist app first thing monday morning. Did not find any information on google so I figured I'd come here. Also, Thank you guys for this sub. ",3,"**Verified Physician here (Orthodontist)**

I took a look at the image your wife sent, and I think I can put your minds at ease. The little pointed tip you're referring to is likely a normal anatomical variation called a ""cusp of Carabelli"" or a ""tubercle."" It's a small, pointed projection that can be found on some people's teeth, usually on the maxillary first molars (which appears to be the tooth in the picture).

It's not a nerve, but rather a benign structural feature that doesn't typically cause any issues. However, it's great that you're taking your daughter to see a dentist on Monday, as it's always a good idea to have a professional take a look and confirm that everything is okay.

Just to reassure you, nerves are not visible on the surface of the tooth, and they're protected by layers of dentin and enamel. So, it's unlikely that the pointed tip is a nerve.

Kudos to you and your wife for being proactive about your daughter's oral health, and I'm glad you found this subreddit helpful!"
<built-in function id>,"Strep Throat(?) not reacting to Antibiotics, throat extremely swollen.","Approximately 8 days ago, I started having a sore throat. Very minor, just enough to notice, assumed it was a cold. Fast forward to Tuesday (3 days ago), I woke up with extreme discomfort in my throat, headache, stomach ache, and when I used a flashlight to look down my throat, I could see some white blotches on my tonsils. I go to the doctors, he does a rapid strep test, which did not register for strep, so he sent a throat culture to the lab. But he said it was probably strep, so he prescribed  Z-pak for me, as I am allergic to Penicillin.

It has only gotten worse. While the stomach and head ache's are gone,my throat is very swollen, my uvula and tonsils have become one swollen, sore covered mass, and I cannot eat anything remotely solid. I just took the 4th set of Z-pak pills (2 pills, once a day). Doc was suppose to call yesterday with lab results, I will be calling today.

To make things even more difficult, I'm am currently transitioning between healthcare providers, and I found out on Tuesday that coverage from my first provider has already ceased, and the new one does not start until August 1st. I'm almost hesitant to go in again, and get hit with a huge bill if it is something worse.

Any ideas?",3,"**Verified Physician here**

I can understand your concern about the medical bills, but please don't hesitate to seek further medical attention if your symptoms worsen. It's great that you're already on antibiotics, but the fact that your symptoms have progressed despite being on the Z-pak for 4 days is concerning.

Given your symptoms and the negative rapid strep test, it's possible that you may have a different type of infection, such as mononucleosis (mono) or a viral pharyngitis. The white blotches on your tonsils could be indicative of a fungal infection, such as oral thrush, although this is less likely.

I would strongly advise you to follow up with your doctor today and get the lab results from the throat culture. If the results are still pending, you may want to ask about getting a mononucleosis test or a complete blood count (CBC) to rule out other conditions.

In the meantime, make sure to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids, such as water, clear broths, or electrolyte-rich beverages like coconut water or sports drinks. You can also try using a humidifier to add moisture to the air, which may help soothe your throat.

Regarding your insurance situation, you may want to reach out to your new provider and ask if they can provide any temporary coverage or assistance until your new plan kicks in. Some providers may offer bridging coverage or financial assistance programs, so it's worth exploring.

Please don't delay seeking medical attention if your symptoms continue to worsen. Your health is the priority, and we can worry about the bills later. **Edit:** I'll add that if you're experiencing difficulty breathing, severe pain, or difficulty swallowing, you should seek immediate attention at an urgent care or ER."

It's essential to recognize that feeling relieved about the idea of death can be a symptom of underlying mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, or suicidal ideation.

<built-in function id>,Easy bruising and petechiae,"I've been having this problem for a while, I often find tiny red spots on my skin, especially on my bra line.Also I bruise much easier, ex: I was bitten by a mosquito and after I scratched it for a while I developed tiny red spots and small bruises in that place.I don't have any obvious problems.My thrombocytes are fine, hemoglobin is fine, liver as well and my blood clotting doesn't seem affected, at least if I consider the blood clotting tests I've made.Is there anything else I should check or maybe I can let this go?20,F.",3,"**Verified Physician here**

Hey OP, thanks for sharing your concerns. I'd like to help you try to get to the bottom of this. Given your normal lab results, including thrombocytes, hemoglobin, liver function, and blood clotting tests, it's possible that we're looking at a more benign condition.

The tiny red spots on your skin, especially on your bra line, could be petechiae, which are small, pinpoint spots that can appear due to increased pressure or friction on the skin. The fact that you're also bruising easily, even from minor trauma like a mosquito bite, suggests that your blood vessels might be more fragile than usual.

I'd like to ask a few follow-up questions:

1. Have you noticed any other symptoms, such as easy bleeding from your gums or nose, or heavy menstrual periods (if applicable)?
2. Are you taking any medications or supplements that could be contributing to your easy bruising or petechiae?
3. Have you experienced any significant stress or changes in your lifestyle recently?

In terms of further testing, you may want to consider speaking with your doctor about:

1. A vitamin C level test, as deficiency can cause easy bruising and petechiae.
2. A platelet function test, which can help assess how well your platelets are working, even if your platelet count is normal.
3. A consultation with a dermatologist to rule out any skin conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms.

It's also possible that you're just someone who bruises easily, and that's not necessarily a cause for concern. However, it's always better to err on the side of caution and explore potential underlying causes.

Keep in mind that I'm just a Reddit doc, and it's always best to consult with your own healthcare provider for personalized advice. I hope this helps, and please let me know if you have any further questions!"
<built-in function id>,Battling BV,"I am 23/f. The only medication I am on is birth control (Gildess FE 1/20). Any help to get my vagina back to normal would be VERY much appreciated.

In April I went to the Gyno for a yellow discharge and slight fishy odor. My main doctor was not available so I saw a PA. She took a culture and told me it looked like BV. She asked if I had a new partner recently and I said yes back in March I became sexually active with a new boyfriend. This is when my problems started occurring. She didn't think it was an STD but I asked to get tested regardless. The culture came back positive for BV and the STD test came back negative for everything.

She prescribed me some tablets to take over a 2 day period that I cannot remember the name of. There was no change from taking these so she prescribed metro gel to use every night for 5 nights. This helped a bit, but I got a yeast infection as is common after using this. So she prescribed 2 fluconazole tablets to take over 2 days to get rid of the yeast infection. The yeast infection went away but just a few days later the yellow discharge returned.

I went in the office again and saw my regular doctor. She took another culture (came back P for BV) and prescribed me metro gel for 10 days and went ahead and gave me the fluconazole tablets for the yeast infection that would occur after. A few days after finishing this the yellow discharge returned. (Those few days it was gone was absolute heaven)

I emailed the doctor and she prescribed 500mg Metro tablets to take every 12 hours for 7 days. I am on the last day of this and the discharge has been constant throughout. So I know I will have to go back in.

Is there any hope?!?



Other things I have done to try to get rid of this...
*I have changed all panties to 100% cotton
*I changed soap to Dove
*I have made sure I am washing properly (just washing the lips)
*I stopped taking as many baths (I shower typically 2X a day)
*Started drinking more water
*Started eating a cleaner diet and lost some weight
*Started taking vitamins (D, B, C, some days I will only take a multi)
*I started eating yogurt every morning
*I started taking a probiotic
*I tried taking Pro-B probiotic for vaginal health but saw no change and it's expensive so I didn't buy another bottle.
*I've started exercising more (I'm not as good about this one)
*I make sure my partner and I are clean before we have intercourse which has of course been rare since this started. (We don't use condoms as I am on BC he also pulls out as to not disrupt my ph)


I am very scared this isn't going to go away. **I feel absolutely disgusting!** Should I get tested for STD's again? They seem to only be prescribing the one drug. Is this the only one available for this problem? Are there any other steps I can take for vaginal health? I hope I'm not forgetting anything.

Thank you in advance!

I'm posting this for a second time because the first didn't show up even after 2 hours. ",3,"**u/ObGyn_MD**: I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. As a verified ObGyn, I'd like to offer some guidance. It sounds like you've been dealing with recurrent bacterial vaginosis (BV), which can be frustrating and affect your self-esteem.

Firstly, kudos to you for taking proactive steps to improve your vaginal health, such as changing to 100% cotton underwear, using gentle soap, and increasing your water intake. These are all great habits to maintain.

Regarding your treatment, it's not uncommon for BV to recur, especially if the underlying cause is not fully addressed. Metronidazole (metro) is a common and effective treatment for BV, but it's possible that your body may not be responding to it as well as expected.

I would recommend discussing the following options with your doctor:

1. **Alternative treatments**: There are other antibiotics available for BV, such as clindamycin or tinidazole. Your doctor may consider switching you to one of these options.
2. **Extended treatment**: In some cases, a longer course of treatment (e.g., 14-21 days) may be necessary to fully clear the infection.
3. **Combination therapy**: Your doctor may consider combining metro with another antibiotic, such as clindamycin, to target the infection from multiple angles.
4. **Recurrence prevention**: To reduce the risk of recurrence, your doctor may prescribe a maintenance therapy, such as a weekly or bi-weekly dose of metro, to help keep the infection at bay.

As for STD testing, it's always a good idea to get tested regularly, especially if you've had a new partner. However, since your previous tests were negative, it's unlikely that an STD is the primary cause of your symptoms.

In addition to the steps you've already taken, you may also consider:

1. **Probiotics**: While you've already tried probiotics, you may want to explore different strains or brands to see if they make a difference.
2. **Vaginal boric acid suppositories**: These can help maintain a healthy vaginal pH and reduce the risk of recurrence.
3. **Avoiding irritants**: Avoid using scented soaps, bubble baths, or douching, as these can disrupt the natural balance of your vagina.

Remember, it's essential to work closely with your doctor to find the right treatment plan for you. Don't hesitate to ask questions or seek a second opinion if you're not satisfied with your current care.

You are not alone, and there is hope for resolving your symptoms. Keep in mind that it may take some trial and error to find the right approach, but with patience and persistence, you can get your vaginal health back on track.

**Edit**: I want to emphasize that it's essential to prioritize your mental health during this time. Dealing with recurrent infections can be emotionally challenging, so don't hesitate to reach out to a therapist or counselor for support."
<built-in function id>,neck pain after wake boarding...webmd said cancer :(,"I went wake boarding yesterday night and woke up with my abdomen (6/10), shoulders (4/10), and neck sore (3/10). I figured I was just sore, popped 3 Advil and went about my day. As the day progressed, my neck got more sore.

At 26 hours I was eating chips and went to pore the bag with my head back. Leaning my head back, I went from a 6/10 to a 8.5/10 with a 5/10 headache. I have iced it for 20 minutes now and it has subsided to a 7/10. 

TL; DR - Went wakeboarding, landed on head, neck hurts day after.
Should I freak out?",3,"**Verified Physician here**

OP, I'd recommend taking it easy and monitoring your symptoms closely. While it's possible that you're just experiencing some delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) from wakeboarding, the fact that your neck pain worsened significantly with a specific movement (leaning your head back) and is accompanied by a headache is concerning.

The mechanism of injury you described (landing on your head) increases the risk of a cervical spine injury or a concussion. Icing has helped alleviate your symptoms, which is good, but it's not a substitute for a proper evaluation.

I'm not saying you should freak out, but it's better to err on the side of caution. I'd recommend scheduling an appointment with your primary care physician or an urgent care center to get checked out. They can assess your neck and spine, check for any signs of a concussion, and provide guidance on further management.

In the meantime, avoid any activities that exacerbate your symptoms, and consider taking it easy for the next 24-48 hours. If you experience any worsening of symptoms, such as numbness, tingling, or weakness in your arms or legs, or if you have difficulty walking or balancing, seek medical attention immediately.

Remember, it's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to head and neck injuries. **Edit:** I'll add that if you're experiencing any symptoms at night, such as difficulty sleeping or worsening pain, you should seek medical attention sooner rather than later."

Posted 2 hours ago

Hey there, fellow Redditor. I'm an orthopedic surgeon, and I'd be happy to help you out. Those little black dots on your ankles sound like they could be a few different things, but I'll give you my two cents.

First, it's great that they don't itch or hurt - that makes some of the more serious conditions less likely. Given the location and appearance, here are a few possibilities:

1. **Tattooing from trauma**: If you've had any injuries or scrapes on your ankles, it's possible that the pigment from the skin has been deposited deeper into the tissue, causing those black dots. The fact that you have scars on your lower leg that have turned black supports this theory.
2. **Hemosiderin deposits**: This is a type of iron deposit that can occur when there's bleeding under the skin. It's possible that you've had some minor trauma or inflammation in the area, leading to these deposits.
3. **Dermatosis papulosa nigra**: This is a benign condition that causes small, dark spots on the skin, often on the legs and ankles. It's more common in people with darker skin tones, but it can occur in anyone.

To get a better idea of what's going on, I'd recommend seeing a dermatologist or a primary care physician for a proper evaluation. They can take a closer look at the spots, ask you some questions about your medical history, and possibly do a biopsy if needed.

In the meantime, keep an eye on the spots and let us know if they change or spread. And don't worry, it's unlikely to be anything serious, but it's always better to get a professional opinion.

Edit: I should note that it's also possible that the spots are just a normal variation in skin pigmentation. But to be sure, it's always best to get a professional evaluation."

",3,"**Verified Physician here**

I took a look at the images you posted. Without a proper examination and medical history, it's difficult to provide a definitive diagnosis. However, I can offer some general insights.

The images appear to show a skin lesion with some scaling and erythema (redness). There are several possible causes, including eczema, psoriasis, or a fungal infection. It's also possible that it could be a benign growth, such as a seborrheic keratosis.

I would strongly advise against waiting decades for an appointment or hoping it will clear up on its own. Skin lesions can sometimes be a sign of an underlying condition that needs attention. I recommend trying to get an appointment with a dermatologist as soon as possible. If you're having trouble getting in with your primary care physician, you may want to consider visiting an urgent care center or a dermatology clinic that offers same-day appointments.

In the meantime, you can try keeping the area moisturized and avoiding any irritants that may be exacerbating the condition. But please don't delay seeking medical attention. It's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your health.

<built-in function id>,Ease my worries please,"My husband is about to see a hematologist and googling around has me worried that he's got something serious, like aplastic anemia. I know we'll find out soon enough, but in the meantime, could you please suggest alternative diagnoses that aren't so scary, so I can think positively? 

He is 50 years old, fit as an ox (bike commutes daily), eats healthy, has taken a multivitamin and a baby aspirin daily for decades, is on no other meds, and is in otherwise excellent health -- except for chronic, unexplained anemia. He has had the anemia for at least a decade.  About 5 years ago, his GP sent him for endoscopy to rule out internal bleeding. Then she put him on a course of B12 injections, that did nothing. However a few months later, his anemia then improved enough that there was no further follow up and he was okay. This year he went back for a routine check up and his anemia is back, and worse than ever. He had another endoscopy and a colonscopy. His GI tract is normal, no gluten intolerance, nothing. His B12 and folate is also normal, and his GP no longer thinks it's related to diet/B12 deficiency. She has referred him to a hematologist. She has run a ton of blood tests, everything is normal, except for his hemoglobin, which is below normal. She is also concerned with his low total blood count. His WBC and platelets are within normal range - but at the very end of low. 

Symptoms - he has all the symptoms of anemia you'd expect. Extreme fatigue, weakness, dizziness, fainting spells, sometimes short of breath, pallor, etc. He has a long history of unexplained, massive bruising (like, covering both his thighs, or his mid-torso). This comes and goes and he's never had a blood test or seen his GP during a bruising episode, but he has reported this to his doctor. On and off history of bleeding gums. And this week he admitted to me that his long bones ache. 

He showed me his blood tests so I did see the scores,  but he then took the paperwork away from me and filed them at work. I have asked for a copy and he won't give me one,  because he knows I am prone to worry too much. He tends to worry too, and I know he is much more worried than he is letting on to me. 

",3,"**Verified Physician here**

I totally understand your concern and willingness to think positively. As a hematologist myself, I'd like to offer some alternative diagnoses that might be less scary than aplastic anemia.

Given your husband's chronic anemia, normal GI tract, and normal B12/folate levels, here are a few possibilities:

1. **Iron deficiency anemia**: Despite normal GI tract, iron deficiency can still occur due to other reasons like inadequate iron absorption or chronic inflammation. His low hemoglobin and total blood count could be related to iron deficiency.
2. **Chronic disease anemia**: This type of anemia is associated with chronic inflammation, which can be caused by various conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, chronic infections, or even chronic stress. His long bone aches and massive bruising could be related to an underlying inflammatory process.
3. **Anemia of chronic kidney disease**: Although his GP has run many blood tests, kidney function tests might not have been thoroughly evaluated. Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease, and his symptoms like fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath could be related to this.
4. **Thalassemia trait**: This is a mild form of thalassemia, a genetic disorder that affects hemoglobin production. It's possible that your husband has a thalassemia trait, which could cause chronic anemia.
5. **Bone marrow disorders**: Conditions like myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) can cause anemia, bruising, and bone pain. However, these conditions are relatively rare and would require further evaluation.

It's essential to note that these are just possibilities, and a thorough evaluation by a hematologist is necessary to determine the underlying cause of his anemia.

I would encourage your husband to be open with his hematologist about his symptoms, medical history, and concerns. It's also important for him to share his blood test results with you, so you can both be informed and supportive throughout this process.

Remember, a diagnosis of aplastic anemia or any other condition is not a guarantee, and it's possible that his hematologist may find a more treatable underlying cause. Try to stay positive and focus on the fact that he's taking proactive steps to address his health concerns.

**Edit:** I want to emphasize that it's great that your husband is seeing a hematologist, and I'm sure they will work together to find the underlying cause of his anemia. Keep us updated on his progress, and feel free to ask any further questions!"
<built-in function id>,"Severe shoulder, neck and back pain after tetanus vaccination","A little less than a week ago I received my tetanus booster shot (the one you receive every decade, at least here in Australia).

A few days later I began experiencing pain around my shoulder blade. This has been progressively getting worse, culminating this evening in a stiff neck and severe pain on my upper left back. It got to the point tonight where I could not move from a lying down position without my wife's assistance, and even then, the pain was excruciating. 

From what I've read, such a degree of pain days after the injection is unusual, but not unheard of. As it didn't click initially that my symptoms were related to the tetanus shot, I began treating it like a sports injury and have tried rest and ice. The ice tonight is what made it so bad. I have, therefore hit the pain killers and heat treatment. 

How long can I expect this to last? Is there anything else I can do to hasten recovery and relieve pain? 

Thanks in advance. ",3,"**Verified Physician here**

Sorry to hear you're experiencing this level of discomfort after your tetanus booster shot. While it's true that severe pain is uncommon, it's not unheard of, especially if the injection was given too close to the shoulder joint or if there was some bleeding or inflammation at the injection site.

The fact that you've tried rest, ice, and now heat treatment is a good start. However, I would recommend that you follow up with your GP or the doctor who administered the vaccine to rule out any other potential causes of your symptoms, such as a rotator cuff injury or a referred pain from another source.

In terms of what you can expect, the pain and stiffness should start to subside within the next 7-10 days, but it may take up to 2-3 weeks for a full recovery. In the meantime, you can try some gentle stretching exercises to help improve your range of motion and reduce stiffness. I would also recommend avoiding any heavy lifting, bending, or strenuous activities that may exacerbate the pain.

Additionally, you may want to consider taking an anti-inflammatory medication, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, to help reduce the inflammation and pain. However, please consult with your doctor before starting any new medication.

It's also worth noting that the use of ice may have actually worsened your symptoms, as you mentioned. While ice can be helpful in the acute phase of an injury, it can sometimes cause more harm than good if used excessively or in the wrong context. Heat treatment, on the other hand, can be beneficial in promoting blood flow and reducing stiffness.

Please keep in mind that this is not a substitute for a proper medical evaluation, and I would strongly encourage you to follow up with your doctor to rule out any other potential causes of your symptoms.

**Edit:** I've seen some comments suggesting that this could be a sign of a more serious condition, such as a vaccine-induced injury. While this is possible, it's relatively rare, and the symptoms you're describing are more consistent with a localized reaction to the vaccine. However, it's always better to err on the side of caution, and a proper medical evaluation will help to determine the cause of your symptoms."

* [two](http://imgur.com/9w1QWlY)
* [three](http://imgur.com/TVDxF0H)

Any idea what these are? The one on my cheek started off as a small scab (maybe a zit or something). I definitely scratched it inadvertently at least once. Since then, it has gotten a bit bigger. It doesn't quite scab over as you can sort of see. The skin feels tight around it. 

The marks on my jaw (you can sort of see it in all of them, but ""three"" focuses on it – albeit, a bit washed out from the light) are similar to the one on my cheek. Some dead skin/sort-of-a-scab flaked off today leaving some fresh-pink skin.

The facial hair is sort of a new thing, so I thought they might be caused by some irritation/ingrown hairs, but that doesn't seem quite right from my previous experiences. I also have about two marks (similar to the stuff on my jaw I suppose) that might be related or simply caused by the irritation of my beard. 

Any help would be seriously appreciated. ",3,"**Verified Physician here**

I've taken a look at the images you provided, and I must say that it's a bit challenging to make a definitive diagnosis without a physical examination and a more detailed history. However, I can offer some possibilities based on what I see.

The lesion on your cheek appears to be a small, ulcerated nodule with a surrounding area of tight skin. The fact that it started as a small scab and has grown in size, despite not fully scabbing over, suggests that it might be a type of skin infection or an inflammatory lesion. The history of scratching the area could have introduced bacteria into the wound, leading to an infection.

The marks on your jawline, as seen in image ""three,"" appear to be similar to the lesion on your cheek. The fact that some dead skin flaked off, leaving fresh pink skin underneath, suggests that these might be resolving on their own.

Given your recent growth of facial hair, it's possible that these lesions could be related to folliculitis, an inflammation of the hair follicles. However, the appearance of these lesions doesn't entirely fit the typical presentation of folliculitis.

Another possibility is that these lesions could be related to a skin condition such as acne, rosacea, or even a dermatitis. The fact that you've had some dead skin flake off, leaving fresh pink skin underneath, suggests that there might be an underlying inflammatory process at play.

I would recommend scheduling an appointment with a dermatologist to get a proper evaluation and diagnosis. They can examine the lesions in person, take a more detailed history, and potentially perform some diagnostic tests (e.g., biopsy, culture) to determine the underlying cause.

In the meantime, I would advise you to avoid scratching or picking at the lesions, as this can introduce bacteria and worsen the infection. Keeping the area clean and applying a topical antibiotic ointment might help prevent further infection.

Please keep in mind that this is just a preliminary assessment, and a definitive diagnosis can only be made by a qualified healthcare professional in person.

**Edit:** I'll be happy to answer any follow-up questions you might have, but please keep in mind that I'm not a substitute for a physical examination and diagnosis by a qualified healthcare professional."
<built-in function id>,Busted my lip and need advice on how to heal it properly!,"I fell off my bike and busted my lip. I got four stitches on the inside, and just scratches on the outside.

I know these are shit, but I am guessing not that important.",3,"**Verified Physician here**

Sorry to hear that you took a tumble off your bike! Fortunately, it sounds like you received proper treatment with the stitches. Now, regarding your questions on how to promote healing and reduce swelling:

1. **Cold compresses**: Apply an ice pack or a cold, damp washcloth to the affected area for 15-20 minutes, 3-4 times a day. This will help reduce swelling and ease pain.
2. **Elevation**: When sleeping, try to keep your head elevated using extra pillows to reduce blood flow to the area and minimize swelling.
3. **Soft food diet**: Stick to a soft food diet for the next few days to avoid irritating the stitches or putting too much pressure on your lip.
4. **Good oral hygiene**: Keep the area clean by rinsing with warm salt water (1/4 teaspoon of salt in 8 ounces of water) several times a day. You can also use an antibacterial mouthwash if prescribed by your doctor.
5. **Follow-up**: Be sure to follow up with your doctor to have the stitches removed and to monitor the healing progress.

As for the bump going down and your lip regaining its original form, it's essential to be patient. The swelling should subside within 7-10 days, but it may take a few weeks for the lip to fully heal and return to its normal shape.

One more thing: keep an eye out for signs of infection, such as increased redness, swelling, or pus. If you experience any of these symptoms, don't hesitate to reach out to your doctor.

Hope this helps, and feel better soon! (And don't worry about the photo quality – it's not about the pics, it's about getting the right advice)"
<built-in function id>,hot sensation in foot,"I've been having this brief ""hot"" sensation in my foot for the past few weeks. It will only last for a few seconds and then go away. It scares me. My skin is never hot to the touch externally, it just feels hot internally. I don't have any other health problems that I'm aware of like diabetes or anything. It's only unilateral, not in both feet. It is near the arch of my left foot, on the inside of the arch kind of. I will notice it maybe 5 - 10 times per day.

EDIT:* I have anxiety issues and sometimes I wonder if it is related to my anxiety.",3,"**Verified Physician here**

I'd be happy to help you try to figure out what's going on with your foot. The sensation you're describing is quite interesting, and I'll do my best to provide some potential explanations.

Firstly, it's great that you've ruled out any obvious underlying conditions like diabetes. Given the unilateral nature of the sensation (only in one foot) and the location near the arch, I'd like to consider a few possibilities:

1. **Morton's neuroma**: This is a common condition where a nerve in the foot becomes irritated, causing a burning or hot sensation. It's usually located between the toes, but it's possible for it to occur in the arch area.
2. **Plantar fasciitis**: This is inflammation of the tissue that supports the arch of the foot. While it typically causes pain or stiffness, some people may experience a burning or hot sensation.
3. **Nerve entrapment**: There are several nerves that run through the foot, and it's possible that one of them is being compressed or irritated, causing the sensation you're experiencing.
4. **Anxiety-related**: As you mentioned, anxiety can sometimes manifest as physical sensations, including burning or hot feelings. This is often referred to as a somatic symptom. It's possible that your anxiety is contributing to or exacerbating the sensation.

To further investigate, I'd recommend seeing a primary care physician or a podiatrist to rule out any underlying foot or nerve issues. They may perform a physical exam, check for any abnormalities, and potentially order some imaging tests (like an X-ray or MRI) to visualize the area.

In the meantime, you may want to try keeping a symptom journal to track when the sensation occurs, how long it lasts, and any potential triggers or relieving factors. This can help you identify any patterns and provide more information for your healthcare provider.

Remember, it's always better to err on the side of caution and get checked out, especially if the sensation is causing you distress or anxiety.

**Edit:** I'll add that if you're experiencing any other symptoms like numbness, tingling, or weakness in your foot, you should seek medical attention sooner rather than later."
<built-in function id>,"Why is my poo so dark, sticky and smelly? I currently on a strict paleo diet","It's weird. Before I went on a diet free of processed, frozen, junk, sugary foods, my poop was okay. You heard of people saying orange-brown is best poo colour? They're right and thats what I've had.

I exercise by running and lifting weights on alternate days. And yet my poop is still sticky, dark green/brown in colour and very smelly.

What the hell is going on? My diet is wheat free, gluten free, diary free, no artificial stuff, no pastas or rice, pure organic. 

",3,"**u/Doc_Gastro**: Verified Physician here. I'd like to offer some insights on your situation. Firstly, congratulations on adopting a healthy diet and exercise routine! However, it's not uncommon for significant dietary changes to affect bowel movements.

The sticky, dark green/brown, and smelly stool you're experiencing could be due to a few factors:

1. **High fiber intake**: Your diet is rich in fiber from all the fruits, vegetables, and almond/coconut flour products. While fiber is essential, a sudden increase can be challenging for your gut to adjust to, leading to changes in stool consistency and color.
2. **Low gut motility**: With the high fiber and low carb content, your gut might be taking longer to move food through the digestive system, resulting in a stickier stool.
3. **Bile production**: The dark green/brown color could indicate that your bile production is adequate, but the smell might suggest that your gut is having trouble breaking down certain compounds.
4. **Potential sulfur imbalance**: The high sulfur content in cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, and kale might be contributing to the smell. Some people have a harder time breaking down sulfur compounds, leading to a stronger odor.

Consider the following adjustments to see if they help:

* **Gradually increase fiber intake**: If you haven't already, try to introduce high-fiber foods more gradually to allow your gut to adjust.
* **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water to help with fiber digestion and gut motility.
* **Probiotics**: Consider adding a probiotic supplement or probiotic-rich foods like fermented vegetables to support gut health.
* **Balance sulfur intake**: You might want to try reducing or rotating your sulfur-rich vegetable intake to see if that affects the smell.

Keep in mind that everyone's gut is different, and it may take some trial and error to find the right balance for your body. If your symptoms persist or worsen, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

Edit: I'd like to add that it's great you're avoiding processed and sugary foods, but it's essential to ensure you're getting enough calories and nutrients from your diet. Make sure you're consulting with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian to ensure you're meeting your nutritional needs."
<built-in function id>,"Stomach upset, anxiety, sleep cycle screwy: What's wrong with me?!","Warning, long post. There's a tl;dr at the end, but you'd be missing a lot of background! :P  Also, I know the whole ""Reddit is not a substitute for professional medical advice"", I'm just trying to see if anyone has experienced anything similar / has any advice.  I'm not the kind of person who really ever goes to the doctor, and if a lifestyle change could help me I'd much rather do that first than spend thousands of dollars to have a doctor tell me the same thing.  However, this has been going on for over a year now and is impacting my life, and I want to do something about it if possible.

Quick about me: Male, 26, 6ft 145lb.

Current complaint:

Basically the biggest issue is that my stomach seems rather overly sensitive.  Every morning it feels uncomfortable / bloated, whether I force myself to eat something or not.  This often persists through the afternoon, and on occasion the entire day.  The discomfort is not so much pain as it is pressure, mild nausea, and bloating / the need to burp.  Sometimes antacids help a little, although that may just be placebo, and forcing myself to burp can help too. BM's range from 3 to 6 on the Bristol scale, varying on a near daily basis, and with the sense that things are not spending more than 12-24 hours in the GI system.  

This issue causes my second complaint, or is perhaps caused by, or perhaps they feed each other, which is kind of anxiety.  That is, when my stomach is upset, it makes me worry about it, which probably makes it more upset.  I'll start worrying that this time my stomach is going to be a little more upset than normal and I'll vomit, or that people will notice my discomfort, or... well, it's hard to describe because I know it's not really a logical feeling, but suffice to say my upset stomach can make me feel quite anxious especially when I'm around other people.

A third thing that may factor in to this situation is my sleep cycle.  I am currently trying to get a good amount of sleep, usually going to bed between 11 and 12, and waking up usually around 9am. Despite this, when I wake up I still feel incredibly tired (though not always sleepy, sometimes I wake up naturally but still feel groggy and tired).  I really can't get going sometimes until 10am, and I'm usually still a bit out of it (and worrying about my upset stomach) for the rest of the morning.


Background:

As for the stomach issue, I don't know where this is coming from. Growing up I was never particularly food sensitive (though I did tend to be a picky eater).  I believe I am mildly lactose intolerant, although I never ate very many milk products anyway -- don't like cheese or yogurt or drinking milk, that pretty much leaves ice cream, and these days I take lactaid with ice cream.  Last year I discovered that I'm apparently allergic to bananas; I had started eating bananas in 2012 and would have them as snacks, but at the same time my digestive health was going downhill, painful upset stomachs and occasionally bloody stool. Took me some time to make the connection, but I eventually realized that my stomach always became upset 15-20 minutes after eating a banana.  Stopped eating them and improved immediately.  However, I guess I'd say I never went quite back to normal, because since them I've been experiencing the symptoms described above.

I'd also classify myself as eating generally decently, I eat out some and cook for myself some, eat a mix of fruits, vegetables, meats, and pastathings, drink probably 80oz of water a day and a little fruit juice, not too into sweet foods / drinks, rarely ever drink alcohol or anything with caffeine. I'm underweight if anything.

For the anxiety, well, I'm not entirely surprised at myself. I've always been extraordinarily shy / had social anxiety issues.  Any time I'm entering a new situation or one where I'm not in control, I'm likely to feel some anxiety.  In my younger years I believe I suffered from depression; though it was never diagnosed or treated, I was really pessimistic about life and occasionally mildly suicidal. In the past 5-6 years, my mental state has dramatically improved with respect to the depression, and I've gained some confidence, but I'm still likely to be very anxious and/or awkward in social situations.  I suppose in my current situation, it's the fact that I can't control my stomach upset, and it might be noticed by others, and it might be potentially embarrassing, that causes my anxiety. Alternately, I'm experiencing stress / generalized anxiety which manifests as an overly sensitive stomach -- this is something I am not really certain about, is the anxiety an amplifying factor in a physical stomach condition, or is an upset stomach a psychosomatic response to a mental condition?

As for my sleep cycle, I've always been a ""night owl"" and have always functioned better at night. That said, in high school and before I had to get up early, and was able to do so without these issues. Throughout college, I also kept a generally earlier schedule.  It's only been the past couple years that I've just been unable to function well in the morning (oh, and if I force myself to get up earlier, my stomach will be even more upset throughout the day).  It doesn't matter if I go to bed at 9pm or at midnight, I still can't function in the morning (and I'll sometimes still take a nap for an hour or two in the late afternoon).  I'd almost describe myself as delayed-phase sleep disorder, because sometimes when I decide to stay up late working, I'll feel best and get the most done from like 11pm to 3-4am.  



So, Reddit, what do you think?  Do I have some physical issue causing my digestive upset, and if so is it some chronic lifelong thing, or something that could be treated / mitigated?  Or do I have some mental issue that's manifesting itself as sleep cycle problems and upset stomach?  Or do I have a sleep disorder that's causing stomach and mood disturbances? or do I have a bad case of intestinal gnomes?

tl;dr:  Suffering from chronic upset stomach (lack of appetite, nausea, bloating and discomfort); anxiety; and delayed sleep cycle / inability to function in the morning.  All three seem to be related, but I'm not sure what the core issue is nor what to do about it.  However, this has been going on for a while and is negatively impacting my quality of life, so I want to figure something out.",3,"**Verified Physician here**

Wow, that's quite a detailed post! I'll try to break it down and offer some insights. Please keep in mind that this is not a substitute for a proper medical evaluation, and I strongly encourage you to consult a doctor (preferably a gastroenterologist) for a thorough assessment.

From what you've described, it's possible that you're experiencing a combination of gastrointestinal (GI) issues, anxiety, and sleep disturbances. Here are some potential factors to consider:

1. **GI issues:** Your symptoms of bloating, discomfort, and nausea could be related to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), or other GI conditions. The fact that you've identified a banana allergy and have lactose intolerance suggests that you may have some underlying sensitivities or intolerances. I'd recommend exploring a low-FODMAP diet or keeping a food diary to track any potential triggers.
2. **Anxiety:** Your social anxiety and past experiences with depression are likely contributing to your current anxiety levels. The gut-brain axis is a well-established concept, where GI issues can exacerbate anxiety, and vice versa. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) might be helpful in managing your anxiety.
3. **Sleep disturbances:** Your delayed sleep phase and difficulty functioning in the morning could be related to an underlying sleep disorder, such as delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS) or circadian rhythm disorder. Establishing a consistent sleep schedule, avoiding screens before bedtime, and exposing yourself to morning sunlight might help regulate your sleep-wake cycle.

Considering the interconnectedness of these issues, I'd suggest the following:

* Consult a gastroenterologist to rule out any underlying GI conditions and discuss potential treatments or lifestyle modifications.
* Explore stress management techniques, such as CBT, MBSR, or yoga, to help alleviate anxiety.
* Speak with a sleep specialist or a primary care physician about your sleep disturbances and potential treatments, such as light therapy or behavioral modifications.

Remember, it's essential to address these issues in a comprehensive manner, rather than trying to tackle each symptom individually. A multidisciplinary approach, involving a team of healthcare professionals, may be the most effective way to manage your symptoms and improve your overall quality of life.

**Edit:** I'd like to emphasize that while lifestyle modifications and self-care strategies can be helpful, they should not replace medical evaluation and treatment. Please do not hesitate to seek professional help if your symptoms persist or worsen."
<built-in function id>,Daughter running high fevers and very agitated,"My four year old daughter is running high fevers 102-104 for a couple of days and has vomited twice 24 hours apart and is very agitated. We took her to the pediatrician and she said her lungs sounded okay and her ears were totally fine. She said that her throat was red and ordered a flu and strep swab. Both of those were negative so she said she believes that it is an upper respiratory infection and to wait a week and come back if she is not better, offering nothing more than Tylenol. My daughter has been sick many times but this time just feels different than the previous times that my daughter has been sick because she is very agitated and can't sleep more than 10 minutes without waking up. Normally when she gets sick she will be very drowsy and knocked out. I can draw on my own personal experiences that when I get sick and I cannot sleep and I am super agitated as opposed to drowsy it has always been a bacterial infection. I am upset that the doctor didn't order a blood test to determine if it is bacterial or viral. I don't want my daughter to suffer a week and risk complications if it is bacterial because the doctor didn't order a simple blood test. ",3,"**Verified Physician here**

I understand your concern as a parent, and it's great that you're advocating for your daughter. However, I'd like to offer some perspective on the situation. 

Firstly, the pediatrician's approach seems reasonable given the initial presentation. The negative flu and strep swabs do suggest that it might be a viral upper respiratory infection, which is a common cause of fever and agitation in children.

Regarding the blood test, it's not always necessary to order one to differentiate between bacterial and viral infections. In fact, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends against routine blood work for children with suspected viral infections, as it can lead to unnecessary testing and potential harm.

That being said, I do agree that your daughter's agitation and sleep disturbance are red flags that warrant further evaluation. It's possible that she might have a bacterial infection, such as pneumonia or a urinary tract infection, that needs to be ruled out.

I would suggest that you schedule a follow-up appointment with the pediatrician sooner than a week, perhaps in 2-3 days, to reassess your daughter's condition. You can also ask the pediatrician to consider ordering a urine analysis or a chest X-ray to rule out other potential causes of her symptoms.

Additionally, you can try to keep a symptom journal to track your daughter's temperature, vomiting, and sleep patterns, which can be helpful in identifying any changes or patterns that might inform the pediatrician's diagnosis.

Remember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your child's health, and I commend you for being an advocate for your daughter. **Please keep in mind that I'm not replacing the pediatrician's advice, but rather offering a second opinion as a fellow physician.**

I can sense your concern for your mother's friend, and I'm happy to help shed some light on his situation. As a physician, I must emphasize that it's great that he's been seeing doctors and undergoing tests, but it's also important to consider that there might be other underlying conditions that need to be explored.

The symptoms you've described, such as shortness of breath, exhaustion, and abnormal breathing patterns, can be indicative of various conditions, including but not limited to:

1. **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)**: Although he's not a heavy smoker, COPD can still be a possibility, especially if he's had a history of smoking. The fact that his lung capacity is smaller suggests that there might be some degree of lung damage.
2. **Pulmonary Hypertension**: This condition can cause shortness of breath, fatigue, and abnormal breathing patterns. It's essential to rule out pulmonary hypertension, especially if his doctors have already checked for other common causes.
3. **Heart Failure**: As a 58-year-old man with a history of rough injuries, it's possible that he might have underlying heart disease, which can lead to shortness of breath and fatigue.
4. **Anemia or other hematological disorders**: These conditions can cause shortness of breath, fatigue, and weakness.

Regarding medications for shortness of breath, there are several options beyond inhalers, such as:

1. **Oxygen therapy**: If his oxygen levels are low, oxygen therapy can help alleviate shortness of breath.
2. **Phosphodiesterase inhibitors**: These medications, such as sildenafil, can help improve exercise tolerance and reduce shortness of breath in patients with pulmonary hypertension.
3. **Beta-blockers**: In some cases, beta-blockers can help reduce symptoms of shortness of breath and fatigue in patients with heart failure.

To progressively increase his lung capacity, the following options can be explored:

1. **Pulmonary rehabilitation**: A supervised exercise program can help improve lung function, increase exercise tolerance, and enhance overall quality of life.
2. **Breathing exercises**: Techniques like diaphragmatic breathing, pursed-lip breathing, and yoga can help improve lung function and reduce shortness of breath.
3. **Physical therapy**: A physical therapist can help him develop a personalized exercise program to improve his overall fitness and reduce fatigue.

I strongly recommend that he consult with a **pulmonologist** or a **cardiologist** to further evaluate his condition and explore these possibilities. It's essential to get a comprehensive diagnosis and develop a personalized treatment plan to address his specific needs.

Please encourage him to ask his doctors about these options and to seek a second opinion if necessary. As a concerned friend, you're doing a great job advocating for him, and I hope this information helps.

<built-in function id>,How can I fight my Rosacea problem,I am a 21 year old male turning 22 next month. I have been fighting Acne Rosacea for around 8 years. I have had times when my face was all red and flaky while at other times not so bad. I'm desperately looking for a way to get rid of this as it greatly affects my social life. I have tried all sorts of moisturizing creams and oils but nothing seems to have a permanent solution to this problem. I would greatly appreciate it if someone could tell me how they have had to overcome this problem because 8 years is a long time and I don't want it to continue for another 8 or more.,2,"**Verified Physician here**

I feel for you, OP. 8 years is a long time to deal with Acne Rosacea, and I can understand how it affects your social life. As a dermatologist, I've seen many patients with similar struggles. While there's no permanent ""cure"" for Rosacea, there are some treatments that can help manage the symptoms.

Firstly, it's great that you've tried various moisturizing creams and oils, but it's likely that you need a more targeted approach. I recommend consulting a dermatologist (if you haven't already) to discuss the following options:

1. **Topical treatments**: Metronidazole, azelaic acid, or sulfacetamide creams/gels can help reduce inflammation and kill bacteria that exacerbate Rosacea.
2. **Oral antibiotics**: In some cases, oral antibiotics like doxycycline or minocycline can be prescribed to reduce inflammation and prevent future flare-ups.
3. **Laser therapy**: Laser treatments, such as pulsed dye laser or intense pulsed light (IPL), can help reduce redness and visible blood vessels.
4. **Sun protection**: UV radiation can trigger Rosacea, so using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 and wearing protective clothing can help prevent flare-ups.
5. **Lifestyle changes**: Avoiding triggers like spicy food, alcohol, and extreme temperatures can also help manage symptoms.

It's also essential to note that Rosacea can be categorized into different subtypes (e.g., erythematotelangiectatic, papulopustular, phymatous, and ocular). A dermatologist can help determine your specific subtype and develop a personalized treatment plan.

Don't lose hope, OP! With the right combination of treatments and lifestyle changes, you can manage your Rosacea and reduce its impact on your daily life. I encourage you to consult a dermatologist and work together to find a solution that works for you.

**Edit:** I'd like to add that there are also some promising new treatments on the horizon, such as topical bromfenac and ivermectin creams, which have shown efficacy in reducing Rosacea symptoms. However, these may not be available or approved in all regions, so it's best to discuss these options with a dermatologist."
<built-in function id>,Fainted the other night... should I be worried?,"So background info first: I'm 21 y/o male, 170lbs, athletic and in good shape. No real past medical history.

So the other night I was out drinking with my apartmentmates. We got drunk before we left and went out to a bar. I had one beer while I was there. This was, by no means, a very drunk night for me - I probably had 8 beers over the course of 4 or 5 hours.

At about 2:00, we hit the McDonalds down the block and were planning on going to another place afterwards (bars close at 3am here). I was feeling fine - we each got some McNuggets and as I was eating them, I started feeling a little lightheaded. A couple minutes later, my vision just tunnel vision-ed to black. I stood there for a few seconds, rather alarmed, before I was like ""guys fuck I can't see anything."" Next thing I know, I woke up slumped down against the wall and people were standing around me. I got up and found a seat and we sat down (after a thoughtful ""keep an eye on him"" from the security guard) and we got a cab home and I was fine for the rest of the night. I was really sweaty after it happened but that went away within like 20 mins. 

I have no idea how this happened. I ate breakfast lunch and dinner. I remember everything, except for the 1-2 minutes between when I couldn't see and when I woke up on the floor. The only thing that I could possibly think it could be is dehydration, because I didn't have much to drink all day. But I thought that the dehydration effect of alcohol took a little longer to sink in since I'd had a lot of fluids and my urine wasn't bright yellow or anything. Again, I wasn't that drunk. I've been much more intoxicated, and nothing like this has ever happened.

TLDR: Passed out for seemingly no reason. WebMD seems to think I might have MS, but that seems unlikely so I figured I'd ask.",2,"**Verified Physician here**

I've read through your post and I must say, it's quite concerning. As a doc, I've seen similar cases, and while it's impossible to diagnose without a proper evaluation, I can try to offer some insights.

Firstly, let's rule out the obvious: dehydration. While it's possible that dehydration contributed to your symptoms, it's unlikely to be the sole cause, especially since you mentioned your urine output was normal.

Given your age, athletic build, and lack of medical history, it's unlikely that you have a chronic condition like MS (as WebMD might have suggested). However, there are a few other possibilities that come to mind:

1. **Vasovagal syncope**: This is a common cause of fainting, especially in young adults. It's often triggered by a combination of factors, including dehydration, stress, and certain medications (although you didn't mention taking any). The fact that you were eating and standing up when it happened could have contributed to the vasovagal response.
2. **Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)**: This is a condition characterized by a rapid heart rate and other symptoms that occur upon standing. While it's more common in women, it can affect men as well. The fact that you were feeling lightheaded and then lost consciousness suggests that your body might have had trouble adjusting to the change in position.
3. **Alcohol-related blackout**: Although you mentioned you weren't extremely drunk, it's possible that the combination of alcohol and other factors (like dehydration or fatigue) could have contributed to a blackout.

To be clear, these are just speculative possibilities, and a proper diagnosis requires a thorough evaluation, including a physical exam, medical history, and possibly some tests (e.g., ECG, blood work).

I would strongly advise you to consult with a primary care physician or a cardiologist to discuss your symptoms in more detail. They can help determine the underlying cause and recommend any necessary tests or treatments.

In the meantime, make sure to stay hydrated, avoid standing for long periods, and try to manage your stress levels.

**Edit:** I've seen some comments suggesting that you might have had a seizure. While it's possible, the fact that you don't remember anything during the 1-2 minutes you were unconscious and that you didn't have any noticeable seizure activity (e.g., convulsions, tongue biting) makes it less likely. However, it's still important to discuss this with a doctor to rule out any underlying conditions."
<built-in function id>,Bug Bite or Should I see a Doctor?,"http://i.imgur.com/orRFLyX.jpg

Found this bump on my elbow today, looks like a bug bite and I have been out around parks and foresty areas lately, the only thing that concerns me is that when I squish it its softer than most bug bites, like more squishy whereas things like mosquito, fly, and wasp bites are usually kind of hard and painful to touch. Just want to get a second opinion, thanks!",2,"**Verified Physician here**

I'd be happy to help you out with your concern. Based on the image you provided, it's difficult to make a definitive diagnosis, but I can offer some insights.

The appearance of the bump does resemble a bug bite, and given your recent activities in parks and forested areas, it's possible that it could be an insect bite. However, the soft and squishy texture you described is unusual for a typical bug bite.

There are a few possibilities to consider:

1. **Dermatological reaction**: It's possible that you're experiencing a dermatological reaction to an insect bite, which could cause the bump to be softer and more squishy than usual.
2. **Cyst or abscess**: Although less likely, it's possible that the bump could be a cyst or abscess, which can be soft and squishy to the touch.
3. **Other skin conditions**: There are other skin conditions, such as a keratosis pilaris or a skin tag, that could present with a similar appearance.

I would recommend scheduling an appointment with a dermatologist or your primary care physician to get a proper evaluation and diagnosis. They can examine the bump in person, take a thorough history, and potentially perform any necessary tests (e.g., biopsy) to determine the cause.

In the meantime, try to avoid scratching or squeezing the bump, as this can lead to further irritation and potentially cause infection.

Keep in mind that this is not a substitute for a professional medical consultation, and I encourage you to seek medical attention if you're concerned about the bump or if it's causing you significant discomfort.

**Edit**: I'll add that if you experience any increasing redness, swelling, or pain around the bump, or if you develop a fever, you should seek medical attention promptly."
<built-in function id>,Few questions regarding my heart.,"Hey everyone here, thanks for being available!

Basic info:

~130lbs
~Age 21

Okay, so first of all, I've never felt my heart as much as I do now. It is extremely strange and sort of hard to describe.

One symptom is an occasional tightness in the region of my heart. It doesn't last very long, nor does it hurt very much, but it's enough for me to to notice and feel uncomfortable.

Second, sometimes I feel it beating abnormally hard. I was a swimmer in high school, but it has been a while since I have regularly worked out. At this point, it just feels like it is beating too hard for what I am doing. This is seldom, but seems to accompany the tightness.

Third, it feels like it is beating too fast as well. Again, this is not all the time, but enough for me to notice.

I've read up on dehydration possibly causing these symptoms and I am trying to drink more water recently but I'm still feeling these them.

Thanks to all those out there who answer, and if you need any more info feel free to ask. I'd really like to hear some useful information before I decide if I want to go get it checked out.",2,"**Verified Physician here**

Hey OP, thanks for sharing your symptoms with us. I'll do my best to provide some insight. 

Firstly, it's great that you're taking proactive steps by increasing your water intake, as dehydration can indeed cause palpitations, tightness, and an irregular heartbeat. However, since you're still experiencing these symptoms, it's worth exploring other potential causes.

The symptoms you've described - occasional tightness, abnormal hardness of heartbeat, and rapid heartbeat - can be associated with various conditions, some of which are benign, while others may require medical attention.

At 21, you're relatively young, and it's possible that you might be experiencing some form of anxiety or stress that's manifesting as palpitations. Have you noticed any triggers or patterns to when these symptoms occur? For example, do they happen when you're under stress, after consuming certain substances (e.g., caffeine, nicotine), or during specific activities?

From a medical standpoint, it's also possible that you might have a benign condition like mitral valve prolapse, anemia, or a thyroid issue. However, without a physical examination and further testing, it's difficult to say for certain.

I would recommend scheduling an appointment with your primary care physician or a cardiologist to discuss your symptoms in more detail. They can perform a physical exam, take a detailed medical history, and potentially order some diagnostic tests (e.g., ECG, echocardiogram) to rule out any underlying conditions.

In the meantime, keep track of when these symptoms occur, and try to note any potential triggers. This will be helpful information to share with your doctor.

Remember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your heart health. If you're experiencing any severe symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please seek immediate medical attention.

<built-in function id>,Abdominal pain for months,"I don't have health insurance while not in school and when I was the school doctors were unhelpful. I've had pain in my lower abdomen for several months now and its always been hard to describe. I've had an appendectomy ~4 years ago and the pain is mostly on the left side anyway so I can safely rule that out. In the beginning I suspected a soy protein intolerance or some such thing as the ingredient ""soy protein isolate"" or soy in larger quantities gave me intense discomfort. (I grew up with soy as a replacement for milk as I have anaphilaxis, so the soy problem was new and has not been professionally diagnosed) Since then I've avoided soy but the pain has never really gone away and now it feels like my insides are sore and has been harder to ignore. No amount of poking or prodding (that the doctors did way back when or when I try now) produces any abnormal pain. The pain is generally between the hips and belly button tending towards the left side. I've also noticed difficulty urinating despite the urge to do so. I suspect the answer is ""Go see a real doctor"" but financially this is not really a viable option. I guess I'm looking for a possible diagnosis or steps I can take on my own to ""heal"" what ever this is.",2,"**Verified Physician here**

I'm so sorry to hear that you're dealing with this persistent abdominal pain and difficulty urinating. I want to start by saying that I completely understand the frustration of not having access to healthcare, and I'll try to offer some guidance while emphasizing that a proper diagnosis and treatment plan can only be provided by a qualified healthcare professional.

Given your history of appendectomy and the location of the pain on the left side, it's possible that you're experiencing some referred pain or discomfort from other organs. The fact that you've noticed difficulty urinating despite the urge to do so raises some red flags, and I want to discuss a few potential possibilities:

1. **Constipation or bowel obstruction**: Although you mentioned that soy protein isolate seemed to trigger discomfort initially, it's possible that you're experiencing some bowel irregularities or obstruction that's causing the pain and urinary difficulties.
2. **Urinary tract issues**: The difficulty urinating could be related to a urinary tract infection (UTI), kidney stones, or other issues affecting the urinary system.
3. **Adhesions or scar tissue**: After an appendectomy, it's possible that adhesions or scar tissue have formed, which could be causing the pain and discomfort.
4. **Hernia or other abdominal wall issues**: Although you mentioned that poking and prodding didn't produce abnormal pain, it's possible that you have a hernia or other abdominal wall issue that's causing the discomfort.

In terms of steps you can take on your own, I would recommend:

1. **Keeping a symptom journal**: Track your pain, bowel movements, and urination patterns to see if you can identify any correlations or triggers.
2. **Staying hydrated**: Drink plenty of water to help prevent constipation and urinary tract issues.
3. **Avoiding irritants**: Continue to avoid soy protein isolate and other potential triggers that may exacerbate your symptoms.
4. **Seeking community resources**: Look into local free clinics, community health centers, or sliding-scale fee clinics that may offer affordable healthcare options.

Again, I want to emphasize that a proper diagnosis and treatment plan can only be provided by a qualified healthcare professional. If you're experiencing severe pain, vomiting, or difficulty breathing, please seek emergency medical attention.

I hope this helps, and I'm happy to answer any follow-up questions you may have. **Please keep in mind that this is not a substitute for a proper medical evaluation, and I strongly encourage you to seek medical attention as soon as possible.**"
<built-in function id>,Are these symptoms related?,"I don't have insurance at the moment because it won't kick in until September but something is worrying me...

I popped a vein in my right wrist a couple days ago by trying to bang in my daughter headboard that was coming apart. Immediately my vein began swelling and you could see that is was bleeding, now it is really bruised about 3 inches all around my wrist. Yesterday (the day after the incident) I got a HORRIBLE headache. I have never had pain like that before, I laid down when I went to bed and was awoken by the pain twice. I took 3 ibuprofen and it did not help at all. The pain was mainly above my eyes and across my forehead. I am wondering if these things are related or if there is any cause for concern... 

Thank you for any help or advice you can give.",2,"**Verified Physician here**

I'm happy to help you out, but please keep in mind that this is not a substitute for an in-person medical evaluation. That being said, I'll do my best to provide some guidance.

The vein injury you described, also known as a superficial thrombophlebitis, is usually not a cause for major concern. However, it's possible that the trauma to your wrist could have caused a more significant injury, such as a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or a hematoma. The bruising and swelling you mentioned are consistent with this type of injury.

The headache you're experiencing could be related to the trauma, but it's also possible that it's a separate issue. The fact that the pain is mainly above your eyes and across your forehead, and that it's severe enough to wake you up from sleep, suggests that it could be a tension headache or a migraine. However, I want to consider other possibilities, such as a potential bleed or a vascular issue.

Given your symptoms, I would recommend seeking medical attention as soon as possible. Even though you don't have insurance yet, many hospitals and urgent care centers offer financial assistance or sliding scale fees. It's better to err on the side of caution and get evaluated to rule out any serious conditions.

In the meantime, I would advise you to monitor your symptoms and watch for any signs of worsening, such as increasing pain, numbness, or tingling in your arm or hand, or difficulty moving your wrist. If you experience any of these symptoms, please seek immediate medical attention.

Remember, this is not a diagnosis, and only a thorough medical evaluation can provide a definitive answer. I hope this helps, and please keep us updated on your situation.

**Edit:** I want to emphasize that if you're experiencing severe headache, confusion, or difficulty speaking, you should call emergency services or go to the nearest ER immediately. These could be signs of a more serious condition, such as a stroke or a bleed."
<built-in function id>,Do splinters come out on their own?,"I've got a splinter in my finger today in camp, and the medic told me that it should come out on its own after two-three days to one week. Some people thought I should take it out with tweezers after making a cut with a needle, but others insisted it will come out on its own. It's a bit deep in.",2,"**Verified Physician here**

I'd advise against attempting to remove the splinter yourself with tweezers and a needle. While it's understandable that you want to get it out, this method can lead to more harm than good, especially if the splinter is deep.

Introducing a needle into the skin can push the splinter further in, making it harder to remove and increasing the risk of infection. Additionally, cutting the skin can lead to scarring and potentially cause more damage to the surrounding tissue.

The medic's advice to wait it out is a good one. In most cases, the body will naturally push out a splinter on its own within a few days to a week, as you mentioned. Keep the area clean and dry, and apply some antibiotic ointment to reduce the risk of infection.

If the splinter is causing significant discomfort, pain, or if you notice signs of infection (redness, swelling, pus), you should seek medical attention. A healthcare professional can assess the situation and remove the splinter safely and effectively.

Remember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your health. Let the body do its thing, and if needed, consult a medical professional for guidance.

**Edit:** I've seen some comments suggesting using a warm compress or baking soda to help bring the splinter to the surface. While these methods may help, they're not a substitute for proper medical care if the splinter is deep or causing issues. Always prioritize your health and safety!"

What could potentially be causing this, and is there anything she can do, other than continuing to pester her GP?",2,"**u/DocOrtho** (verified physician) here. I'm not trying to be a keyboard doctor, but I'll offer some potential insights. It's concerning that your family member is experiencing recurrent, random cramping episodes that are severe enough to cause limping.

Given the lack of a clear pattern or trigger, it's possible that this could be related to a neurological or musculoskeletal issue. Here are a few potential causes that might be worth exploring:

1. **Muscle spasms**: These can be caused by a variety of factors, including dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, or underlying muscle or nerve disorders.
2. **Peripheral neuropathy**: This is a condition that affects the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord, and can cause muscle cramps, weakness, and pain.
3. **Fibromyalgia**: This is a chronic condition characterized by widespread muscle pain, fatigue, and tender points.
4. **Nutritional deficiencies**: Deficiencies in vitamins like magnesium, potassium, or calcium can contribute to muscle cramps.

It's interesting that her identical twin doesn't have similar issues, which suggests that there might be an environmental or lifestyle factor at play.

As for next steps, I would recommend that she consider seeking a referral to a specialist, such as a neurologist or a physiatrist (a doctor who specializes in physical medicine and rehabilitation). They may be able to provide a more thorough evaluation and help identify potential underlying causes.

In the meantime, here are a few things she can try:

* **Stay hydrated**: Encourage her to drink plenty of water throughout the day, and consider increasing her intake of electrolyte-rich foods or supplements.
* **Stretching and exercise**: Gentle stretching and exercise, such as yoga or swimming, may help improve muscle flexibility and reduce cramping.
* **Heat or cold therapy**: Applying heat or cold packs to the affected area may help relieve cramping and discomfort.
* **Keep a symptom journal**: Encourage her to keep a log of when the cramps occur, what she's doing at the time, and any potential triggers or relieving factors. This may help identify patterns or correlations that can inform further evaluation and treatment.

I hope this helps, and I wish her the best of luck in finding a solution to these frustrating and painful episodes."

Hey there, fellow Redditor. I came across your post and found it quite intriguing. As an ophthalmologist, I'd like to offer some insights. 

It's not uncommon for people to have varying responses to substances, and the effects on the eyes can be quite individualized. The fact that your pupils don't dilate or constrict in response to certain substances, despite feeling their other effects, could be due to several factors.

One possibility is that you might have a condition called ""adenylate cyclase deficiency"" or a variation in the genes that code for the muscarinic receptors in your eyes. These receptors play a crucial role in regulating pupil size. However, without further testing, it's difficult to say for certain.

Another factor to consider is the anatomy of your iris. Some people have a more rigid iris structure, which could affect the way their pupils respond to different stimuli.

Regarding your colorblindness, it's unlikely to be directly related to your pupil response. Color vision deficiency is typically related to the genetics of your cone cells, whereas pupil response is governed by the autonomic nervous system and the muscles in your iris.

If you're concerned about your eye health or would like to explore this further, I recommend consulting an ophthalmologist for a comprehensive eye exam. We can discuss your medical history, perform some tests, and see if there's an underlying condition that might be contributing to your unique response to substances.

Keep in mind that this is just speculation, and a proper evaluation is necessary to determine the cause. I hope this helps, and please let me know if you have any further questions!"

I'm just worried that maybe the medicine messed me up somehow? Idk, but should i see a doctor or should i not really worry too much. Im not sure if i have health insurence (im 17) so i don't really want to worry my parents if it's nothing important. Any advice is welcome. ",2,"**Verified Physician here**

I'm glad you're reaching out for advice, and I'll do my best to help you. First, let me say that it's great you're taking an active role in your health, especially at 17.

Now, regarding your symptoms: it's possible that the combination of DayQuil, NyQuil, and Mucinex could be contributing to your stomach pain. These medications can be harsh on the stomach, especially when taken in high doses or for an extended period.

The fact that you've been taking DayQuil and NyQuil 4 times a day for over a week is a bit concerning. These medications are meant to be taken as needed, and taking them that frequently could lead to stomach irritation, among other issues.

The addition of Mucinex, which is an expectorant, might not be directly related to your stomach pain, but it's possible that the combination of all these medications is causing an imbalance in your gut.

As for your dream and the pain persisting after waking up, it's not uncommon for people to experience vivid dreams or even lucid dreaming when they're not feeling well. However, the fact that the pain was intense and noticeable in your dream, and then persisted after waking up, suggests that there might be an underlying issue that needs attention.

I would strongly advise you to see a doctor, regardless of your insurance situation. Stomach pain can be a symptom of many underlying conditions, some of which can be serious. It's always better to err on the side of caution, especially when it comes to your health.

If you're concerned about your parents finding out, you could consider reaching out to a school nurse or a community clinic that offers free or low-cost healthcare services. Many cities also have urgent care centers that can provide affordable care without requiring insurance.

Please don't hesitate to seek medical attention. Your health is worth it, and it's always better to be safe than sorry.

**Edit:** I'll add that inducing vomiting is not a recommended solution for stomach pain, as it can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. If you're experiencing persistent stomach pain, it's essential to seek medical attention to rule out any underlying conditions that may require treatment."

Male",2,"**Verified Physician here**

I'm glad you're concerned about the appearance and potential long-term effects of the injury. As a doc, I'll try to provide you with some guidance.

Firstly, it's not uncommon for people to experience minor injuries or abrasions during masturbation, especially when exploring new areas like the prostate gland. However, it's great that you're taking proactive steps to address the issue.

The description of the injury suggests that you may have caused a small tear or fissure in the perianal skin, which can lead to scarring. The fact that it hasn't healed completely after a year is concerning, but it's not uncommon for scars to persist.

To address your concerns, I would recommend consulting a colorectal surgeon or a gastroenterologist who specializes in anorectal disorders. They can assess the area and provide a proper diagnosis. A regular doctor may not have the necessary expertise to address this specific issue.

During the consultation, the specialist will likely perform a visual examination and may use a anoscope or proctoscope to get a better look at the area. They may also take a history of your symptoms and any previous treatments you've tried.

Treatment options may include:

1. Topical creams or ointments to promote healing and reduce scarring.
2. Minor surgical procedures to repair the tear or remove excess scar tissue.
3. Laser therapy to stimulate collagen production and improve skin texture.

It's essential to note that any surgical procedure carries risks, and it's crucial to discuss these with your specialist.

To find a qualified colorectal surgeon or gastroenterologist, you can:

1. Ask your primary care physician for a referral.
2. Check with your insurance provider for a list of in-network specialists.
3. Search online for specialists in your area and read reviews from other patients.

Remember to be open and honest with your healthcare provider about your symptoms and concerns. They're there to help you, and it's essential to address any issues that affect your quality of life.

**Edit:** I want to emphasize that it's crucial to prioritize your comfort and confidentiality when discussing sensitive topics like this. Don't hesitate to ask questions or seek a second opinion if you're unsure about any aspect of your care."
<built-in function id>,[Meta] Race?,What exactly do you mean with race? I guess this is a subreddit for humans only?,2,"Username: throwaway_md_phd 

Comment:
""Hey fellow Redditors, verified physician here. I think there's been a misunderstanding. When we refer to 'race' in a medical context, we're not talking about the social or cultural construct of race, but rather the biological and genetic variations that exist between different populations. These variations can affect how certain diseases manifest, how we respond to medications, and even our susceptibility to certain conditions.

For example, sickle cell disease is more prevalent in populations of African descent, while cystic fibrosis is more common in those of European ancestry. This doesn't mean that these conditions are exclusive to these groups, but rather that there's a higher incidence due to genetic factors.

So, to answer your question, this subreddit is indeed for humans only, but our discussions around 'race' are focused on the biological aspects that impact our health, not the social or cultural implications. Hope this clears things up!""

When under mental (job interview, school exam) or physical stress (running, demanding workout) I start to retch and have to stop what I am doing and kneel down, shut my eyes and stay immobile to control my breath for 5-15 seconds while it passes away. I never wommit, but feel like I will any second.

It all started when I was in elementary school and realized that sit-ups make me nauseaus. I had no other sympthoms back than right until first year of university where the stress levels were much higher. There 10-30 minutes before exams I started the retching part.

At the age of 30 I gained a lot of weight, I was about 104kg and 185cm tall. I did martial arts, but the above described sympthoms appeart. It was so bad that just sitting in my car seemed to compress my stomach and lungs and I started retching.

At 32 I lost almost 20kgs and all sympthoms wanished. Now I'm back at about 95 and the sympthoms are worse than ever, especially because I had a knee injury last autumn and my conditioning is pretty bad right now.

The problem now is that I also seem to have decreased lung capacity. When I'm out of breath, the retching starts immedietly. I never smoked or drinked alcohol ever and still try my best during trainings, but my condition doesn't improve much.

During wrestling when my upper body is compressed, I immedietly start to panic beacause I'm out of breath. Never had this problem before.

Eating a lot and sugary drinks (especially energy drinks) make the sympthoms appear for sure, don't even have to stress or move a lot.

This could be just reflux or hiatus hernia, but I don't get the usual reflux sympthoms (no heartburn, no pain, no acid taste... maybe the cough part, but I'm not sure).

Is this reflux or something else?",2,"**Verified Physician here**

I'd like to start by saying that your English is actually quite good, so no need to apologize!

Now, regarding your symptoms, I must say that they're quite intriguing. While reflux or hiatus hernia could be potential causes, I'm not convinced that's the primary issue here. The fact that you don't experience typical reflux symptoms like heartburn, acid taste, or pain makes me think there might be more to it.

Your history of symptoms starting with sit-ups in elementary school, worsening with stress and physical exertion, and improving with weight loss suggests that there could be a component of vagal nerve stimulation or gastrointestinal motility issues at play. The fact that you experience retching and a sensation of impending vomiting without actually vomiting also points towards a more complex issue.

The recent development of decreased lung capacity and panic when your upper body is compressed during wrestling is concerning and might indicate a separate issue, potentially related to respiratory or cardiac function.

I'd like to propose a few potential diagnoses that might be worth exploring:

1. **Vasovagal syncope**: This condition is characterized by a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure, often triggered by stress, pain, or physical exertion. It could explain your retching, nausea, and sensation of impending vomiting.
2. **Gastroparesis**: This is a condition where the stomach muscles are weakened, leading to delayed gastric emptying and potentially causing nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort.
3. **Anxiety-related gastrointestinal symptoms**: Your symptoms seem to be exacerbated by stress and anxiety, which could be contributing to your gastrointestinal issues.
4. **Respiratory issues**: Your decreased lung capacity and panic during wrestling might indicate an underlying respiratory condition, such as asthma or exercise-induced bronchospasm.

I strongly recommend that you consult a gastroenterologist and a cardiologist to rule out any underlying conditions that might be contributing to your symptoms. In the meantime, you may want to try avoiding trigger foods and drinks, such as sugary drinks and energy drinks, and see if that helps alleviate your symptoms.

Keep in mind that this is just a speculative discussion, and a thorough evaluation by a medical professional is necessary to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms.

**Edit:** I'd like to add that it's great that you've never smoked or consumed alcohol, and it's excellent that you're proactive about your health. Keep up the good work, and I hope you find some answers soon!"
<built-in function id>,So.... should I do call ahead seating for a liver transplant or...?,"I've been reading about tylenol being dangerous if more than 4000mg is taken in a day and now I really need to know if I'm killing my liver. I have a ton of surgical rods and screws in my back from scoliosis correction and also have severe fibromyalgia. To help relieve pain I take tramadol, cymbalta, and of course tylenol. 

I take 3900 mg of tylenol pretty much every day, sometimes more if I need to take a 3rd dose. I generally take 3 650mg tablets first thing in the morning and again late in the afternoon or at bedtime. Sometimes I wind up taking 3 doses in a day when I'm busy going all day or if I'm having a really painful day which would bring me up to a total of 5850mg in 24 hrs. 

I know I should probably take less but this is what I've had to do to function somewhat normally, and honestly I barely get by. 

So.... call ahead seating for a liver transplant?",2,"**u/DocOrtho** (verified physician) 

OP, I'm glad you're taking proactive steps to understand the risks associated with your medication regimen. As an orthopedic surgeon, I've worked with many patients who have undergone scoliosis correction and deal with chronic pain management.

Firstly, it's essential to acknowledge that your pain management needs are significant, and I'm not here to judge your current regimen. However, I do want to emphasize the importance of being mindful of your acetaminophen (Tylenol) intake.

The recommended daily limit of 4000mg is a general guideline, and individual tolerance can vary. Taking 3900mg daily, with occasional spikes to 5850mg, does put you at a higher risk for liver damage. It's not necessarily a guarantee of liver failure, but it's a concern that warrants attention.

I would strongly advise you to consult with your primary care physician or a gastroenterologist to discuss your medication regimen and potential alternatives. They can help you assess your liver function and explore other pain management options that might be more liver-friendly.

In the meantime, I recommend considering the following:

1. **Dose reduction**: If possible, try to reduce your daily Tylenol intake to 3000-3500mg. This might require adjusting your dosing schedule or exploring alternative pain relievers.
2. **Alternative pain management**: Discuss other options with your doctor, such as physical therapy, nerve blocks, or alternative medications like NSAIDs (under close supervision) or opioids (if necessary).
3. **Liver function monitoring**: Regularly check your liver enzymes (AST, ALT) to ensure they're within normal ranges.
4. **Vitamin supplementation**: Consider taking a vitamin E supplement, as it may help mitigate some of the oxidative stress associated with acetaminophen use.

Regarding the ""call ahead seating for a liver transplant"" comment, I wouldn't say it's imminent, but it's essential to take proactive steps to protect your liver health. By working with your healthcare team and exploring alternative pain management strategies, you can reduce your risk and maintain optimal liver function.

Please keep in mind that I'm not your personal physician, and it's crucial to consult with your healthcare team before making any changes to your medication regimen. They can provide personalized guidance and help you develop a plan to minimize your risk while managing your chronic pain."
<built-in function id>,Tonsil Problems,"Sore throat developed 02/12/2014. Initially was one-sided, suspecting it to be gland pain because I felt it in my neck. Two days after, lots of exudate in both tonsils - had to drain it off just to swallow somewhat comfortably. Today, Im at the point I can barely swallow again. Cant see exudate superficially, but I can ""inside"" if that makes sense. Also developed abscess-looking lesions next to my tonsils, albeit small. No fever... yet anyways. 

I definitely plan on seeking professional help for this, but Im wondering if I should wait till the clinic opens on Tuesday, go to the ED, or maybe even go out of town to see if a walk-in clinic is open in the morning?

20 y/o F, wisdom teeth removed one month ago, no current meds but had penicillin VK and percocet for the surgery. Have had about 10 or so similar episodes within the past 6 months. Some of these tested positive for strep (medicated accordingly) while others did not. I asked about seeing an ENT, but clinic said that was a little over the top. Havent sought treatment for about half of these because the practitioners make it seem like its not worth the time. What do I need to ask or say to get the most out of my appointment?",2,"**Verified Physician here**

OP, I'm glad you're planning to seek professional help for this recurring issue. Given your symptoms, I would strongly advise against waiting until Tuesday to see a doctor. The presence of exudate, abscess-like lesions, and difficulty swallowing are all concerning signs that warrant prompt attention.

I would recommend going to the ED or a walk-in clinic as soon as possible. Your symptoms could be indicative of a peritonsillar abscess, which is a serious complication that requires timely treatment. The fact that you've had multiple episodes of similar symptoms in the past six months suggests that you may have a underlying condition that needs to be addressed.

When you see a doctor, be sure to provide a detailed history of your symptoms, including the timeline of when they started and any previous episodes. Mention your recent wisdom teeth removal and the medications you took for it. Also, inform them about your previous strep tests and treatments.

To get the most out of your appointment, ask the following questions:

1. What is the likely cause of my symptoms, and what are the possible complications if left untreated?
2. What diagnostic tests (e.g., throat culture, imaging studies) will be performed to determine the underlying cause?
3. What treatment options are available, and what are the potential risks and benefits of each?
4. Given my history of recurrent episodes, what can be done to prevent future occurrences?
5. Would a referral to an ENT specialist be beneficial in this case, and why or why not?

Regarding your previous experiences with practitioners downplaying your symptoms, I would suggest being firm and assertive about your concerns. You can say something like:

""I've had multiple episodes of similar symptoms in the past six months, and I'm concerned that there may be an underlying condition that needs to be addressed. I would like to discuss the possibility of a referral to an ENT specialist and explore options for preventing future episodes. Can we work together to develop a plan to manage my symptoms and prevent future complications?""

Remember, as a patient, you have the right to advocate for yourself and seek a second opinion if you're not satisfied with the care you're receiving. Don't hesitate to push for the attention you need, and I hope you get the help you require soon."
<built-in function id>,Heart failure?,"It's probably unlikely that I have heart failure (18 y/o), but I think I'm feeling short of breath when on my bed (actually it feels like more like a tight or heavy sensation in my throat/upper chest and kinda like I need to cough). I've felt this for 4 days now and it's worse at night. I have pretty bad anxiety over my heart and I'm constantly worrying about it.

Doing some tests at home my BP was measured at 122/80 and capillary refill is under 1 second when pressing on my toe nail. Resting heart rate is 55-70 BPM and there's usually no irregularities with the beat, but it does speed up/down sometimes weirdly and I get palpitations on occasion.

Looking online, these results seem to be pretty much perfect. But is it possible that some people with heart failure can get good results like mine, or would they get far worse results?",2,"**Verified Physician here**

OP, I totally get why you're worried, and it's great that you're taking proactive steps to monitor your health. First, let me put your mind at ease a bit: at 18 years old, heart failure is indeed extremely unlikely. Your symptoms, while uncomfortable, are more likely related to anxiety or other non-cardiac issues.

That being said, I'll address your question. It is theoretically possible for someone with heart failure to have relatively normal vital signs, especially if the condition is mild or compensated. However, it's unlikely that someone with significant heart failure would have a normal blood pressure, heart rate, and capillary refill time like yours.

In heart failure, you'd typically expect to see signs of decreased cardiac output, such as:

* Low blood pressure
* Elevated heart rate (usually >100 bpm)
* Prolonged capillary refill time (>2 seconds)
* Possibly irregular heart rhythms or other signs of cardiac dysfunction

Your results, as you've noted, are indeed within normal limits. The occasional palpitations and variations in heart rate can be benign, especially in someone with anxiety.

Given your symptoms and test results, I think it's more likely that your discomfort is related to anxiety or possibly other factors like:

* Acid reflux or GERD (can cause a tight sensation in the throat/upper chest)
* Allergies or postnasal drip (can cause a sensation of needing to cough)
* Musculoskeletal issues (e.g., tightness in the chest wall or throat)

I'd recommend speaking with your primary care physician or a cardiologist to discuss your symptoms and concerns. They can perform a more thorough evaluation, including a physical exam, ECG, and possibly other tests to rule out any underlying conditions.

In the meantime, try to manage your anxiety with relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga. This might help alleviate some of your symptoms.

Remember, it's always better to err on the side of caution and consult with a healthcare professional if you're concerned about your health. **Stay calm, and let's get to the bottom of this!**"
<built-in function id>,Sore throat: Bacteria or virus,"How can I tell if I have a viral infection or a bacterial infection, especially if I don't have tonsils?  

My throat is increasingly sore, and when I use a light to see in my throat, my whole throat is red.  There is no telltale whiteness anywhere, but the back of my throat isn't smooth either - it has relatively pale raised areas arranged in superior-inferior- running lines especially down each side of my throat.  The pain is localized to naso- and oro-pharynx.  My voice is not suffering, but swallowing really hurts.  I just want to be able to rule out bacterial infection so I don't waste time at the doctor. Can you guys help?

I'm on tylenol for pain, and no other meds.  Female, 30s, normal weight.

Thanks for any advice.",2,"**Verified Physician here**

I'd be happy to help you out. First, kudos to you for being proactive and trying to self-assess your symptoms. However, I have to advise you that it's not always easy to distinguish between viral and bacterial infections without a proper evaluation.

That being said, based on your symptoms, it's possible that you have a viral pharyngitis. The fact that your throat is red and sore, with pale raised areas (which could be lymphoid follicles), is consistent with a viral infection. The absence of tonsillar exudate (whiteness) also leans towards a viral etiology.

The pain localized to the naso- and oro-pharynx, and the difficulty swallowing, are also common symptoms of viral pharyngitis. The fact that your voice is not affected is also a good sign, as hoarseness is often associated with more severe infections, such as bacterial epiglottitis.

However, it's essential to note that some bacterial infections, like strep throat, can present with similar symptoms. And, as you don't have tonsils, it's possible that the usual signs of strep throat (e.g., tonsillar exudate) might not be present.

Given your symptoms, I would recommend that you still consult with a doctor to rule out a bacterial infection. A throat swab or rapid strep test can help determine if you have a streptococcal infection. Additionally, your doctor can assess your overall clinical presentation and decide if antibiotics are necessary.

Tylenol is a good choice for pain management, but if your symptoms worsen or you develop a fever, difficulty breathing, or other concerning symptoms, seek medical attention promptly.

Don't worry about ""wasting time"" at the doctor's office – it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your health. Hope this helps, and feel better soon!"
<built-in function id>,"Strep Throat, Skipping Antibiotics","Hi guys. I'ev been diagnosed with strep throat. But I really really don't want to take the antibiotics. They reek havoc on your body and kill off all of the good bacteria. Apparently even after one course of antibiotics, 6 months later, your microbiome is still in recovery. Is this a foolish idea? Is the risk of rheumatic fever greater than the damage that will be caused by the antibiotics? What sort of odds am I dealing with here? Thanks.

Location Australia",2,"**u/DocDownUnder** (Verified Physician) 

Hey there, I'm a GP from Australia. I understand your concerns about antibiotics, but I have to advise you that in the case of strep throat, the benefits of taking antibiotics far outweigh the risks.

Firstly, the risk of rheumatic fever is a serious one. It's a complication of untreated strep throat that can lead to heart valve damage, arthritis, and even neurological problems. In Australia, the incidence of rheumatic fever is still significant, particularly in Indigenous communities, but it can affect anyone.

The risk of developing rheumatic fever if you don't take antibiotics is around 1-3% if you're treated with just pain relief and supportive care. However, if you take a full course of antibiotics, this risk drops to less than 0.5%.

Regarding the impact of antibiotics on your microbiome, it's true that they can disrupt the balance of your gut bacteria. However, the effects are usually temporary, and your microbiome can recover within a few weeks to months. The study you're referring to likely looked at the effects of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which are indeed more disruptive than the narrow-spectrum antibiotics typically used to treat strep throat (e.g., penicillin or amoxicillin).

It's also worth noting that the consequences of untreated strep throat can be more severe than the temporary disruption of your microbiome. For example, untreated strep throat can lead to abscesses, sinusitis, and even glomerulonephritis (a kidney infection).

I'm not saying that antibiotics are without risks, but in this case, the benefits of taking them to prevent complications like rheumatic fever outweigh the potential risks. I would strongly advise you to take the antibiotics as prescribed by your doctor.

If you're concerned about the impact on your microbiome, you can discuss with your doctor the possibility of taking a probiotic supplement during and after the antibiotic course to help mitigate the effects.

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns.

**Edit:** I should add that if you have a penicillin allergy or are concerned about antibiotic resistance, there are alternative treatments available. However, these should be discussed with your doctor, and it's essential to weigh the risks and benefits of each option."
<built-in function id>,Bad reaction to bp meds,"30 f have been on atenolol 25 mg for bp since i was 20. Was put on lisinopril for a short time, but had to come off of it due to getting heart palpitations. Recently me and my husband are trying for a baby so the doctor decided to try me on 100 mg of labeterol 2 times a day.  Ive been on that for a few days and yesterday my bp spiked to 133/98 and pulse at 100. I felt like i was going to pass out, shaky, and headache. I call my doctor and was told to either wait it out or go back on my atenolol.  The whole reason to go off of the atenolol was because it is a betta blocker and not the best thing to be on when pregnant.  This morning bp at 130/102 and pulse 83. 

I did try and go off bp meds over the summer with doctors care and had a similar reaction. Racing pulse and bp.  Just not sure if there is something else to try.  Not so happy with my  docs response. Any advice is greatly appreciated. :-)",2,"**Verified Physician here**

I can understand your frustration with your doctor's response, and I'm happy to offer some advice. First, let me commend you for being proactive about your blood pressure management, especially considering your plans for pregnancy.

It's not uncommon for patients to experience a rebound effect when switching from a beta blocker like atenolol to a different medication. The fact that you had a similar reaction when trying to go off BP meds over the summer suggests that you may be experiencing a withdrawal-like effect.

Labetalol is a good choice for pregnant women with hypertension, but it's possible that the dose may need to be adjusted or combined with other medications to achieve better control.

I would recommend discussing the following options with your doctor:

1. **Dose adjustment**: Consider increasing the labetalol dose to 200-300 mg twice a day, as this may help improve blood pressure control.
2. **Addition of a diuretic**: A low-dose diuretic like hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) may help augment the blood pressure-lowering effect of labetalol.
3. **Alternative medications**: If you're experiencing intolerable side effects or inadequate blood pressure control with labetalol, your doctor may consider switching you to a different medication like nifedipine or methyldopa, which are also safe for use during pregnancy.
4. **Close monitoring**: Given your history of rebound hypertension, it's essential to monitor your blood pressure closely, ideally with a home blood pressure monitor, to ensure that your medication regimen is effective and safe.

Regarding your doctor's response, I would encourage you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss your concerns and explore the above options. It's essential to work with your healthcare provider to find a solution that balances your blood pressure control with the need to minimize potential risks during pregnancy.

Remember, as a patient, you have the right to advocate for yourself and seek a second opinion if you're not satisfied with your care.

**Please keep in mind that I'm not your doctor, and it's essential to consult with your healthcare provider before making any changes to your medication regimen.**

<built-in function id>,"[serious] A friend's son was diagnosed with Diffuse Pontine Glioma, have any of you heard of alternative treatment options that work?","Diffuse Pontine Glomma, as I understand it, does not have a mainstream treatment that seem very promising. I've heard of a cannabis extract that is supposedly helpful for this particular tumor. We do not live in a state that allows medical marijuana, so it seems difficult to find a lot of information on those treatment options. We have also heard of an organic medicine made from muscadine grapes. Being that there is such a low survival rate and there are little treatment options, we are looking for any information and opinions available. I'm personally a fan of the reddit layout and told him I would ask these questions here. ",2,"**Verified Physician here**

I'm so sorry to hear about the Diffuse Pontine Glioma (DIPG) diagnosis. As a pediatric neuro-oncologist, I've had the unfortunate experience of dealing with this devastating disease. I'll try to provide some insight and address the treatment options you've mentioned.

Firstly, it's true that conventional treatment options for DIPG are limited, and the prognosis is generally poor. Current standard treatment typically involves radiation therapy, which can help alleviate symptoms, but unfortunately, it's not curative.

Regarding the cannabis extract, there's ongoing research into the potential benefits of cannabinoids in treating various types of cancer, including brain tumors. However, it's essential to note that the evidence for its effectiveness in DIPG is mostly anecdotal and not yet supported by robust clinical trials. That being said, some studies suggest that cannabinoids may have anti-tumor effects and could potentially enhance the efficacy of conventional treatments.

As for the muscadine grape extract, I'm not aware of any conclusive evidence supporting its use in treating DIPG. While muscadine grapes do contain compounds with potential anti-cancer properties, the scientific evidence is largely preclinical, and more research is needed to determine its safety and efficacy in humans.

I understand the desperation that comes with a lack of effective treatment options, and I appreciate your willingness to explore alternative approaches. However, as a physician, I must emphasize the importance of discussing any complementary or alternative therapies with your healthcare team before pursuing them. This ensures that you're not inadvertently interacting with conventional treatments or putting your loved one at risk.

If you're interested in exploring cannabis-based treatments, I recommend reaching out to organizations like the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) or the Cannabis Research Initiative, which may be able to provide more information on access and clinical trials.

For those interested in learning more about DIPG research and clinical trials, I recommend visiting the websites of organizations like the DIPG Registry, the Children's Brain Tumor Foundation, or the National Cancer Institute.

Keep in mind that every patient's situation is unique, and it's crucial to have open and honest discussions with your healthcare team about the potential benefits and risks of any treatment approach.

**Edit:** I'll be happy to answer any follow-up questions or provide more information on DIPG treatment options. Please feel free to ask."
<built-in function id>,"Random chest pain, two occurrences in past year","Medical background: Healthy, if out of shape(but not overweight) 20-year-old. Occasional alcohol use and cigar smoking(once or twice a month for both), used to smoke marijuana. Family history on my mothers side of heart disease, heart attacks in both grandparents on that side and my grandpa died of it when he was in his 50s or 60 or something, though my grandma lived to the ripe old age of 93, finally succumbing to cancer.

I'm currently in Health 101, and was reading the chapter on cardiovascular disease. The section on angina reminded me of two occurrences in chest pain over the past year, and since I have the family history of heart problems, figured I should pay attention to that more then I have been.

The first time, back in June, I was just sitting in a work training session, taking notes, and I got a pain in my chest. It was most painful when I inhaled, the more full my lungs were the more painful it was. I took shallower breaths, didn't say anything, and it went away in about ten minutes.

The second time, just a couple weeks ago, I had the same pain upon waking up. I was laying down, and getting up made it hurt more, as did taking deep breaths, so I just took shallow breaths and the pain subsided within 5 or 10 minutes.

Does any doctor know what this possibly could be? Is it a lung issue or a heart issue? And are these symptoms serious enough that I should see a doctor?",2,"**u/DocCardio** (Verified Physician) 

Hey there, thanks for sharing your concerns. I'll do my best to provide some insight. Given your family history of heart disease, it's great that you're being proactive about your health.

The symptoms you're describing - chest pain that worsens with deep breathing and improves with shallower breaths - are more suggestive of a musculoskeletal or respiratory issue rather than a cardiac one. The fact that the pain is exacerbated by inhalation and relieved by exhalation is a classic characteristic of pleuritic chest pain, which is often related to the lungs or the lining surrounding the lungs (pleura).

That being said, it's essential to consider your family history and rule out any cardiac causes. I would recommend scheduling an appointment with your primary care physician to discuss your symptoms in more detail. They may perform a physical exam, take a more detailed history, and potentially order some diagnostic tests (e.g., ECG, chest X-ray) to evaluate your symptoms.

In the meantime, pay attention to any other symptoms you may be experiencing, such as shortness of breath, dizziness, or palpitations. If you experience any severe or persistent chest pain, don't hesitate to seek immediate medical attention.

It's also worth noting that your occasional cigar smoking and alcohol use may not be directly related to your symptoms, but they can still have negative effects on your cardiovascular health. Consider speaking with your doctor about ways to reduce or quit these habits.

Remember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your health. Even if your symptoms are unlikely to be related to a serious cardiac issue, it's still important to get checked out and establish a baseline for your health.

**Edit:** I should mention that if you experience any chest pain that is severe, crushing, or radiates to your arms, back, or jaw, you should seek immediate medical attention. These symptoms could be indicative of a more serious cardiac issue, such as a heart attack."

Had congestion, indigestion, sinus pressure, cough etc. He's fine now with only a minor cough and is back at work. Every single night around 6 or 7, after dinner, he is out cold for the rest of the night. Like, instant rem sleep within ten minutes out cold. 

Is this normal recovery? I just want to make sure it's not a symptom of something else. ",2,"**u/Doc_Gastro** (Verified Physician) 

Hey there, concerned spouse! I'm a gastroenterologist, but I'll do my best to offer some general insights. It's great to hear that your husband is feeling better after being down with a virus.

The excessive sleepiness you're describing, particularly the rapid onset of REM sleep, could be related to a few factors. After a viral illness, it's common for people to feel fatigued as their body recovers. This is often due to the lingering effects of the infection, as well as the body's efforts to rebuild and restore its energy reserves.

However, there are a few potential concerns that come to mind, given your husband's history of Crohn's disease. Although he's been in remission for 3 years, it's possible that the viral illness could have triggered a mild flare or caused some gastrointestinal upset, leading to malabsorption of nutrients or changes in his gut microbiome. This, in turn, might contribute to his excessive sleepiness.

Another possibility is that your husband might be experiencing a condition called post-viral fatigue syndrome (PVFS). This is a relatively common phenomenon where people feel persistently tired and sluggish after a viral illness, often due to inflammation and immune system dysregulation.

To put your mind at ease, I'd recommend that your husband schedule a follow-up appointment with his primary care physician to discuss his symptoms and rule out any underlying conditions that might be contributing to his excessive sleepiness. A thorough physical exam, complete blood count (CBC), and possibly some other lab tests (e.g., electrolyte panel, liver function tests) might be helpful in determining the cause of his symptoms.

In the meantime, encourage your husband to maintain a balanced diet, stay hydrated, and engage in regular physical activity to help his body recover. It's also essential to monitor his symptoms and seek medical attention if he experiences any worsening of his condition, such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, or severe abdominal pain.

5 years ago I had these red painful bumps appear on my left neck, it is still there and painful once a month. 3 years ago a pilonidal cyst appeared.

I haven't actually seen any doctor since the stint 7 years ago. The reason is my fear of needles. 

My last visit she asked for a blood sample, I went fully knowing I would pass out like every other time. However this time just before i passed out i felt an extreme pain in my chest, honestly the only way i can describe it was when my lung collapsed after falling off a hill, when i awoke i had doctors standing all around me. My heart had stopped. They were freaking out, they put me on some kind of monitor and what not. They made a note to my doctor, but i never returned.

I had to have a filling done a year after that incident, i warned them i would pass out. That same painful feeling happened, and when i came to they were on the phone with 911 and freaking out. They said they couldn't feel a pulse, on staff nurse did cpr and called 911.

I'm so glad you reached out for help, and I'm more than happy to try and assist you. First and foremost, please know that your fear of needles is completely understandable, and we can work with that.

Given your history, I have to say that I'm concerned about the potential underlying causes of your symptoms. The severe abdominal pain 7 years ago, the weight loss, and the subsequent development of a pilonidal cyst and painful neck bumps are all red flags that need to be investigated.

The fact that you've had two episodes of syncope (passing out) with associated chest pain and cardiac arrest is extremely alarming. This suggests that there may be an underlying cardiac issue that needs to be addressed ASAP.

I strongly advise you to seek medical attention from a primary care physician or a specialist (e.g., gastroenterologist, cardiologist) who can help you unravel the mysteries of your symptoms. I understand that your fear of needles is a significant barrier, but there are ways to work around this. Many medical procedures can be done with minimal or no needle use, and we can explore those options with you.

In Toronto, you have access to excellent medical facilities and specialists. I recommend reaching out to a hospital or a clinic that offers anxiety-friendly or needle-phobia accommodations. Some hospitals even have specialized programs for patients with needle phobia.

To get you started, I suggest you contact the University Health Network (UHN) or the Sinai Health System, both of which have excellent gastroenterology and cardiology departments. They may have resources and specialists who can help you navigate your fears and get the medical attention you need.

Remember, your health is paramount, and we can work together to find ways to manage your anxiety and get you the care you deserve.

**Please take care of yourself and don't hesitate to reach out for help. You got this!**

Edit: I'll add that there are also some amazing resources available in Toronto for patients with needle phobia, such as the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) or the Toronto General Hospital's Anxiety Disorder Clinic. They may be able to provide you with additional support and guidance."
<built-in function id>,My GF has a question about something that came out of her nose.,"Me and my GF were in the car driving. She was messing with a sore spot in her nose and then blood starting coming out pretty heavily. It bled for maybe a minute or two. Then she said she noticed and felt something kind of hanging out, so she pulled on it and she pulled a long bloody looking thing out. The bleeding stopped as soon as she pulled it out. I think it is just bloody mucus but she is very concerned about it so I figured I would ask you guys. I actually have a picture of it taken right after it was pulled out if that is necessary I can post it.",2,"**Verified Physician here**

I'd love to help you and your girlfriend out. Based on your description, it's possible that the ""long bloody looking thing"" she pulled out is indeed a blood clot or a piece of nasal mucosa that had formed as a result of the bleeding. The fact that the bleeding stopped immediately after she pulled it out suggests that it might have been a clot that was obstructing the bleeding vessel.

However, I do have to advise that it's generally not recommended to pull or manipulate any foreign objects or tissues from the nose, as this can lead to further injury or infection.

If your girlfriend is still concerned, I would recommend that she schedule an appointment with an ENT (ear, nose, and throat) specialist or a primary care physician to get checked out. They can take a look at her nose and make sure there's no underlying issue that needs to be addressed.

As for the picture, I'd rather not have you post it here, but if your girlfriend does end up seeing a doctor, it might be helpful to show it to them as part of her medical history.

Please keep in mind that this is not a substitute for a proper medical evaluation, and if your girlfriend is experiencing any further bleeding, pain, or discomfort, she should seek medical attention ASAP.

Edit: Also, just to reassure you, it's unlikely that the object she pulled out is anything sinister like a parasite or a tumor. But again, it's always best to get a professional opinion to put your minds at ease."
<built-in function id>,Can someone with business degrees/experience work and make a difference in the medical field?,"Was not sure where to ask this, feel free to point me to another subreddit.  

Hypothetically, can someone with multiple business degrees and a business background transition to some sort of position in the medical field that would actually make a difference?  If the answer is yes, where and how would that person begin looking?
",2,"**u/DocSmithMD** (Verified Physician) 

Hey there, I'd be happy to help. As a physician, I've seen many individuals from non-medical backgrounds transition into the medical field and make a significant impact. With multiple business degrees and a business background, you may be surprised at how transferable your skills are.

There are several areas where your skills could be valuable:

1. **Medical Management**: With your business background, you could consider roles like hospital administration, medical practice management, or healthcare consulting. These positions often require strong business acumen and leadership skills.
2. **Healthcare IT**: If you have experience with data analysis or project management, you might be interested in healthcare IT, where you could work on implementing electronic health records, telemedicine platforms, or health information exchanges.
3. **Public Health**: Your business skills could be applied to public health roles, such as program management, policy development, or health education. You could work for government agencies, non-profits, or private organizations.
4. **Medical Research Administration**: If you're interested in research, you could consider roles like clinical research coordinator, research administrator, or grants manager. These positions often require strong organizational and business skills.

To get started, I'd recommend:

1. **Networking**: Reach out to professionals in the medical field and ask about their experiences. Attend industry events, join professional organizations, or connect with people on LinkedIn.
2. **Online Courses**: Take online courses or certification programs to learn about the medical field and gain relevant skills. Some popular options include Coursera, edX, or the American Medical Association's (AMA) online courses.
3. **Volunteering**: Volunteer at hospitals, clinics, or non-profits to gain hands-on experience and build connections in the field.
4. **Job Boards**: Search for job openings on websites like HealthCareJobSite, MedicalGroupManagement, or the American Hospital Association's (AHA) job board.

Some specific job titles to consider:

* Medical Practice Manager
* Healthcare Consultant
* Clinical Research Coordinator
* Public Health Program Manager
* Health Information Manager

Remember, transitioning to a new field takes time and effort. Be prepared to learn, adapt, and be open to new opportunities. Good luck!

Edit: I'd be happy to answer any follow-up questions or provide more specific advice if you'd like."
