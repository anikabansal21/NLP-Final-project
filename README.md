# Medical Hypothesis Generation using the Reddit AskDocs Dataset

With more people turning to online forums like Redditâ€™s r/AskDocs for medical advice, it is crucial to understand whether AI can provide useful preliminary health assessments. This project explores the effectiveness of Natural Language Processing in identifying potential medical conditions from user-generated posts. We scraped and processed AskDocs data and are using a fine-tuned language model to generate two types of responses: a list of possible diagnoses with test recommendations and a Reddit-style physician reply. To evaluate accuracy, we compare these AI-generated responses to actual top-voted physician comments using a similarity metric. Our goal is to determine how well AI aligns with expert medical opinions and whether it can be a reliable tool for preliminary guidance. The results will help assess the feasibility of AI-assisted symptom analysis, particularly for those with limited access to healthcare.
