It had about 3% Benzyl Alcohol added to it and was filtered through a 0.22nm nylon filter.

The next day, I couldn't walk. I have swelling at the injection site and around/above my knee cap. It's very, very difficult to walk, and the pain is near unbearable if my leg isn't elevated/at level with my body; so I've been near bed ridden for the past 4 days.

Symptoms: Swelling, slight redness at injection site, warmth from injection site, spontaneous (what I can only describe as) muscle spasms; a few times a day, whether going to the bathroom or lying in bed not moving, my quadricep will twitch/spasm. Injection site is very 'tough' and 'hard'; tissue scarring? 

There is no visible abscess. I don't have a fever. No difficulty in breathing or elevated heart rate. No vomiting. My appetite seems a bit suppressed, but could be because of the heat we're experiencing. I did have a nose bleed yesterday but that could've been from my mild hay fever. Tensing my leg is pretty much impossible. Bending my leg at the knee to any acute angle is impossible; feels like my knee and injection site has massive pressure on them. I've been sleeping with my leg slightly elevated, trying to keep off it (probably only spending about 10 minutes on my feet a day).

I've been taking ibuprofen for pain/inflammation but doesn't help.

Basically my two problem areas are at injection site, around upper/outer kneecap (where the quad ends?).

I'll be going to my doctor Monday.


I used a 1.25"" 25g needle, area swabbed with an alcohol prep pad before injection. I inject 4-5ml often (though it's been about 4 months since I injected either of my quads, keeping it to delts, pecs and glutes).

I'm 24 and have been having bowel disturbances for about five months -- frequent (at least 4-6 times/day) bowel movements, bloating and gas every evening, and about once a month or two some light rectal bleeding. Besides bloating dull ache, I feel occasional sharp pain in my lower left abdomen. 

Have done tests to rule out common viral/bacterial infections and ulcerative colitis and tried IBS medicine for a month (not much help). 

Saw bowel specialist who is having me get some blood work and another pathogen test done. He recommended a colonoscopy to check for inflammation.

Now, I'm from the US but currently work in New Zealand and would have to pay for the colonoscopy (about $1500-2000) out of pocket if I get it done here. If I wait until I come home in December, my US insurance would probably cover it.

I'm hoping for advice on any danger there could be in waiting. I guess I've gotten used to the symptoms and have found that changing my diet alleviates them a bit. If symptoms go away, would it be a bad idea to forego a colonoscopy all together?

I've read stories about younger people getting bowel cancer and having it go undetected because it's seen as a disease older people get, so that's in the back of my mind.

Complicating or perhaps explaining all this, I was on two courses of antibiotics for unrelated infections during the last four months and three other courses in the past year....and I have had severe food allergies all my life to dairy, nuts and shellfish. When I was younger I had minor allergies to wheat and soy.

No real past medical history.

So the other night I was out drinking with my apartmentmates. We got drunk before we left and went out to a bar. I had one beer while I was there. This was, by no means, a very drunk night for me - I probably had 8 beers over the course of 4 or 5 hours.

At about 2:00, we hit the McDonalds down the block and were planning on going to another place afterwards (bars close at 3am here). I was feeling fine - we each got some McNuggets and as I was eating them, I started feeling a little lightheaded. A couple minutes later, my vision just tunnel vision-ed to black. I stood there for a few seconds, rather alarmed, before I was like ""guys fuck I can't see anything."" Next thing I know, I woke up slumped down against the wall and people were standing around me. I got up and found a seat and we sat down (after a thoughtful ""keep an eye on him"" from the security guard) and we got a cab home and I was fine for the rest of the night. I was really sweaty after it happened but that went away within like 20 mins. 

I have no idea how this happened. I ate breakfast lunch and dinner. I remember everything, except for the 1-2 minutes between when I couldn't see and when I woke up on the floor. The only thing that I could possibly think it could be is dehydration, because I didn't have much to drink all day. But I thought that the dehydration effect of alcohol took a little longer to sink in since I'd had a lot of fluids and my urine wasn't bright yellow or anything. Again, I wasn't that drunk.

No real past medical history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the other night I was out drinking with my apartmentmates. We got drunk before we left and went out to a bar. I had one beer while I was there. This was, by no means, a very drunk night for me - I probably had 8 beers over the course of 4 or 5 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At about 2:00, we hit the McDonalds down the block and were planning on going to another place afterwards (bars close at 3am here). I was feeling fine - we each got some McNuggets and as I was eating them, I started feeling a little lightheaded. A couple minutes later, my vision just tunnel vision-ed to black. I stood there for a few seconds, rather alarmed, before I was like &amp;quot;guys fuck I can&amp;#39;t see anything.&amp;quot; Next thing I know, I woke up slumped down against the wall and people were standing around me. I got up and found a seat and we sat down (after a thoughtful &amp;quot;keep an eye on him&amp;quot; from the security guard) and we got a cab home and I was fine for the rest of the night. I was really sweaty after it happened but that went away within like 20 mins. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea how this happened. I ate breakfast lunch and dinner. I remember everything, except for the 1-2 minutes between when I couldn&amp;#39;t see and when I woke up on the floor. The only thing that I could possibly think it could be is dehydration, because I didn&amp;#39;t have much to drink all day. But I thought that the dehydration effect of alcohol took a little longer to sink in since I&amp;#39;d had a lot of fluids and my urine wasn&amp;#39;t bright yellow or anything. Again, I wasn&amp;#39;t that drunk. I&amp;#39;ve been much more intoxicated, and nothing like this has ever happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Passed out for seemingly no reason. WebMD seems to think I might have MS, but that seems unlikely so I figured I&amp;#39;d ask.&lt;/p&gt;

Okay, so first of all, I've never felt my heart as much as I do now. It is extremely strange and sort of hard to describe.

One symptom is an occasional tightness in the region of my heart. It doesn't last very long, nor does it hurt very much, but it's enough for me to to notice and feel uncomfortable.

Second, sometimes I feel it beating abnormally hard. I was a swimmer in high school, but it has been a while since I have regularly worked out. At this point, it just feels like it is beating too hard for what I am doing. This is seldom, but seems to accompany the tightness.

Third, it feels like it is beating too fast as well. Again, this is not all the time, but enough for me to notice.

I've read up on dehydration possibly causing these symptoms and I am trying to drink more water recently but I'm still feeling these them.

You might be having two separate issues or your abdominal pain can be related to what seems to be urinary retention. Since your primary concern is abdominal pain lets go that route first. To help further we need description of your stool in as much detail as possible (e.g. lots of people complain of bloody stool; medical people want to hear is the blood just on the outside or is intermixed into the stool as the differential will change from hemorrhoids to possibly GI bleed/cancer). Color of stool is important, and consistency. Please keep in mind we aren't there to see it or run any diagnostic tests on you so you will have to be our ""eyes and ears"" so to speak. The pain you are having in your abdomen, does it move or radiate anywhere else? Do you have any family history of bowel problems? You gave an excellent narrowing of location of the pain and that really helps. The fact that you said this has been happening for months and in the LLQ of your abdomen initially makes me think long term issues in the colon (as there isn't really any other organs in that area, differential may include a renal stone tracking down the ureter).

Your doctor has followed a very standardized protocol. The fact that the azithromycin is not working for you indicates that the infection may be more viral in nature. During my peds rotation it was extremely difficult to tell what was Strep and what was mononucleosis (usually caused by EBV or CMV- both viruses) cause the presentation can be very similar. What are your demographics? If you are between 16-25 yo the chances of it being mono is much higher than it being strep throat. Both mono and strep can have those white blotches (exudates) and both present very similarly. Do you have any abdominal tenderness especially in the left upper quadrant? I highly recommend you to avoid contact sports for at least 2-3 wks or until your doc lets you know what he thinks. People infected with mono have splenomegally (enlarged spleen) and are prone to splenic ruptures if even a little rough with their body. ,t3_1immti,3.0,AskDocs,tailofspence,cb62jfo,1374254704,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1immti

In April I went to the Gyno for a yellow discharge and slight fishy odor. My main doctor was not available so I saw a PA. She took a culture and told me it looked like BV. She asked if I had a new partner recently and I said yes back in March I became sexually active with a new boyfriend. This is when my problems started occurring. She didn't think it was an STD but I asked to get tested regardless. The culture came back positive for BV and the STD test came back negative for everything.

She prescribed me some tablets to take over a 2 day period that I cannot remember the name of. There was no change from taking these so she prescribed metro gel to use every night for 5 nights. This helped a bit, but I got a yeast infection as is common after using this. So she prescribed 2 fluconazole tablets to take over 2 days to get rid of the yeast infection. The yeast infection went away but just a few days later the yellow discharge returned.

I went in the office again and saw my regular doctor. She took another culture (came back P for BV) and prescribed me metro gel for 10 days and went ahead and gave me the fluconazole tablets for the yeast infection that would occur after. A few days after finishing this the yellow discharge returned. (Those few days it was gone was absolute heaven)

I emailed the doctor and she prescribed 500mg Metro tablets to take every 12 hours for 7 days. I am on the last day of this and the discharge has been constant throughout. So I know I will have to go back in.

Is there any hope?!?



Other things I have done to try to get rid of this...
*I have changed all panties to 100% cotton
*I changed soap to Dove
*I have made sure I am washing properly (just washing the lips)
*I stopped taking as many baths (I shower typically 2X a day)
*Started drinking more water
*Started eating a cleaner diet and lost some weight
*Started taking vitamins (D, B, C, some days I will only take a multi)
*I started eating yogurt every morning
*I started taking a probiotic
*I tried taking Pro-B probiotic for vaginal health but saw no change and it's expensive so I didn't buy another bottle.
*I've started exercising more (I'm not as good about this one)
*I make sure my partner and I are clean before we have intercourse which has of course been rare since this started. (We don't use condoms as I am on BC he also pulls out as to not disrupt my ph)


I am very scared this isn't going to go away. **I feel absolutely disgusting!** Should I get tested for STD's again? They seem to only be prescribing the one drug.

It should be mentioned though that many of the studies were poorly executed studies and further research is being done on the matter. Your doctors are very correct though to continue just treating you based on thinking it is recurrent BV as this occurs in up to 30% of women within the first 3 months of initial treatment and up to 50% of woman within a year of initial treatment (you are well within the recurrent range).

There's a tl;dr at the end, but you'd be missing a lot of background! :P  Also, I know the whole ""Reddit is not a substitute for professional medical advice"", I'm just trying to see if anyone has experienced anything similar / has any advice.  I'm not the kind of person who really ever goes to the doctor, and if a lifestyle change could help me I'd much rather do that first than spend thousands of dollars to have a doctor tell me the same thing.  However, this has been going on for over a year now and is impacting my life, and I want to do something about it if possible.

Quick about me: Male, 26, 6ft 145lb.

Current complaint:

Basically the biggest issue is that my stomach seems rather overly sensitive.  Every morning it feels uncomfortable / bloated, whether I force myself to eat something or not.  This often persists through the afternoon, and on occasion the entire day.  The discomfort is not so much pain as it is pressure, mild nausea, and bloating / the need to burp.  Sometimes antacids help a little, although that may just be placebo, and forcing myself to burp can help too. BM's range from 3 to 6 on the Bristol scale, varying on a near daily basis, and with the sense that things are not spending more than 12-24 hours in the GI system.  

This issue causes my second complaint, or is perhaps caused by, or perhaps they feed each other, which is kind of anxiety.  That is, when my stomach is upset, it makes me worry about it, which probably makes it more upset.  I'll start worrying that this time my stomach is going to be a little more upset than normal and I'll vomit, or that people will notice my discomfort, or... well, it's hard to describe because I know it's not really a logical feeling, but suffice to say my upset stomach can make me feel quite anxious especially when I'm around other people.

A third thing that may factor in to this situation is my sleep cycle.  I am currently trying to get a good amount of sleep, usually going to bed between 11 and 12, and waking up usually around 9am. Despite this, when I wake up I still feel incredibly tired (though not always sleepy, sometimes I wake up naturally but still feel groggy and tired).  I really can't get going sometimes until 10am, and I'm usually still a bit out of it (and worrying about my upset stomach) for the rest of the morning.


Background:

As for the stomach issue, I don't know where this is coming from. Growing up I was never particularly food sensitive (though I did tend to be a picky eater).  I believe I am mildly lactose intolerant, although I never ate very many milk products anyway -- don't like cheese or yogurt or drinking milk, that pretty much leaves ice cream, and these days I take lactaid with ice cream.  Last year I discovered that I'm apparently allergic to bananas; I had started eating bananas in 2012 and would have them as snacks, but at the same time my digestive health was going downhill, painful upset stomachs and occasionally bloody stool. Took me some time to make the connection, but I eventually realized that my stomach always became upset 15-20 minutes after eating a banana.  Stopped eating them and improved immediately.  However, I guess I'd say I never went quite back to normal, because since them I've been experiencing the symptoms described above.

I'd also classify myself as eating generally decently, I eat out some and cook for myself some, eat a mix of fruits, vegetables, meats, and pastathings, drink probably 80oz of water a day and a little fruit juice, not too into sweet foods / drinks, rarely ever drink alcohol or anything with caffeine. I'm underweight if anything.

For the anxiety, well, I'm not entirely surprised at myself. I've always been extraordinarily shy / had social anxiety issues.  Any time I'm entering a new situation or one where I'm not in control, I'm likely to feel some anxiety.  In my younger years I believe I suffered from depression; though it was never diagnosed or treated, I was really pessimistic about life and occasionally mildly suicidal. In the past 5-6 years, my mental state has dramatically improved with respect to the depression, and I've gained some confidence, but I'm still likely to be very anxious and/or awkward in social situations.  I suppose in my current situation, it's the fact that I can't control my stomach upset, and it might be noticed by others, and it might be potentially embarrassing, that causes my anxiety. Alternately, I'm experiencing stress / generalized anxiety which manifests as an overly sensitive stomach -- this is something I am not really certain about, is the anxiety an amplifying factor in a physical stomach condition, or is an upset stomach a psychosomatic response to a mental condition?

As for my sleep cycle, I've always been a ""night owl"" and have always functioned better at night. That said, in high school and before I had to get up early, and was able to do so without these issues. Throughout college, I also kept a generally earlier schedule.  It's only been the past couple years that I've just been unable to function well in the morning (oh, and if I force myself to get up earlier, my stomach will be even more upset throughout the day).  It doesn't matter if I go to bed at 9pm or at midnight, I still can't function in the morning (and I'll sometimes still take a nap for an hour or two in the late afternoon).  I'd almost describe myself as delayed-phase sleep disorder, because sometimes when I decide to stay up late working, I'll feel best and get the most done from like 11pm to 3-4am.  



So, Reddit, what do you think?  Do I have some physical issue causing my digestive upset, and if so is it some chronic lifelong thing, or something that could be treated / mitigated?  Or do I have some mental issue that's manifesting itself as sleep cycle problems and upset stomach?  Or do I have a sleep disorder that's causing stomach and mood disturbances? or do I have a bad case of intestinal gnomes?

tl;dr:  Suffering from chronic upset stomach (lack of appetite, nausea, bloating and discomfort); anxiety; and delayed sleep cycle / inability to function in the morning.  All three seem to be related, but I'm not sure what the core issue is nor what to do about it.  However, this has been going on for a while and is negatively impacting my quality of life, so I want to figure something out.",JustAnotherAltAcct,,,,0,,,False,t3_1xhtfa,True,False,,,1392007595.0,False,verified-doc,,0.0,t1_cfcojt3,Physician,1432351447.0,True,False,2,0,0,t5_2xtuc,t3_1xhtfa,False,"What you are describing here is basically a textbook case of mild irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and a mild social anxiety disorder combined. IBS is a functional bowel disorder strongly associated with anxiety and other psychosocial factors. Patients with IBS also have increased motility of their GI-tract (which you are describing) and often increased sensitivity to distention of their GI-tract. About 20% of the general population fulfill criteria for IBS, so it's very common. 

So the question is, what can be done to help you? Sometimes it can be helpful to eliminate/reduce certain things from your diet. About 20% will have some relief of symptoms by eliminating lactose (which you already did) and wheat from their diets. Also reducing caffeine (which can also increase anxiety, but you rarely use it it seems) and artificial sweeteners can help. 

As for the anxiety, there are many options. Being shy and feeling social anxiety in new situations is extremely common - so common that we may call it normal. You can always take some measures yourself to help your anxiety - like exposing yourself to new situations more often and going out to meet people more often. I know this can be very difficult, because it's unpleasant, but it will help in the long run. For example, when you have a choice between going out and staying home, try to always chose the option of going out. Just know that social anxiety is very normal, and everyone feels some anxiety in new situations where they dont have control. As long as you're able to live with it and go on with your daily activites it doesn't necessarily have to be a big problem. 

However if your anxiety comes to the point where you are isolating yourself or unable to go on with your normal life, I'd recommend seeing a psychologist. The best treatment right now is cognitive behavioral therapy, which is generally very effective. There are also drug treatments with SSRI's (anti-depressants) and specifically for anxiety and IBS, amitripyline. 

I think your sleep cycle-issues are also related to your anxiety, but might also be symptoms of depression.

When under mental (job interview, school exam) or physical stress (running, demanding workout) I start to retch and have to stop what I am doing and kneel down, shut my eyes and stay immobile to control my breath for 5-15 seconds while it passes away. I never wommit, but feel like I will any second.

It all started when I was in elementary school and realized that sit-ups make me nauseaus. I had no other sympthoms back than right until first year of university where the stress levels were much higher. There 10-30 minutes before exams I started the retching part.

At the age of 30 I gained a lot of weight, I was about 104kg and 185cm tall. I did martial arts, but the above described sympthoms appeart. It was so bad that just sitting in my car seemed to compress my stomach and lungs and I started retching.

At 32 I lost almost 20kgs and all sympthoms wanished. Now I'm back at about 95 and the sympthoms are worse than ever, especially because I had a knee injury last autumn and my conditioning is pretty bad right now.

The problem now is that I also seem to have decreased lung capacity. When I'm out of breath, the retching starts immedietly. I never smoked or drinked alcohol ever and still try my best during trainings, but my condition doesn't improve much.

During wrestling when my upper body is compressed, I immedietly start to panic beacause I'm out of breath. Never had this problem before.

Eating a lot and sugary drinks (especially energy drinks) make the sympthoms appear for sure, don't even have to stress or move a lot.

This could be just reflux or hiatus hernia, but I don't get the usual reflux sympthoms (no heartburn, no pain, no acid taste... maybe the cough part, but I'm not sure).

Even for confirmed streptococcal infection it's very debatable if antibiotics are beneficial if you compare side effects with benefits. URTI go away on their own, even if they are bacterial, with or without antibiotics, usually in 3-10 days. 

There isn't really a blood test to determine if you have a bacterial or viral infection unfortunately. Sometimes we use CRP, and there is some evidence to say that if the CRP is &gt;40, it's quite likely to be a bacterial infection, but it isn't a very good or specific test. 

However I haven't seen your daughter and I haven't examined her myself, so I can't really say anything more than that. If you are concerned, take her to another pediatrician or family doctor and get a second opinion. Parents intuition that something is wrong and out of the ordinary is always a concern, at least for me.

You should look for other methods of treating your pain. Some things to consider, all which are evidence based treatment options for fibromyalgia (and most of them are also helpful in other types of chronic pain): 

Changing Cymbalta into a TCA (tricyclic antidepressant) taken in the evening. TCA's are the first choice antidepressants for fibromyalgia, proven to be more effective than Cymbalta.

Regular aerobic exercise with moderate to high intensity.

Cognitive-behavioral therapy.

Group-therapy, especially training in heated swimming pools is proven to have good short term effects on pain from fibromyalgia.  ",t1_cfennc5,1.0,AskDocs,lilleboff,cff5mr3,1392384629,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1xtzyf

It's worth noting that although I'm not overweight, I have an abnormal lifestyle. I'm extremely sedentary (I sit for probably at least 12 hours on a normal day and almost never exercise), and I have a pretty poor diet. I eat fruit and vegetables, but I also eat too much food with high fat-content (pizza) and sugar (like fruit juices and cookies).
Over the last couple weeks, I've noticed a few things that are concerning to me. I've had at least a couple instances of what I think are described as heart palpitations. I wasn't able to get any sleep last night after a palpitation. 
A few times recently, when I laid down to go to sleep at night, I heard my pulse/heartbeat in my ear. And on a few mornings, I woke up with slightly cramped calves. I've also woken up with my arm completely ""asleep"". And when I shovel snow outside, my hands go numb within 20 minutes, even though I wear fairly well-insulated winter gloves. This may not be related, but I've also noticed that my ears seem to ""pop"" a bit when I swallow. I don't remember that happening until recently. 

I'm worried that I might already have some sort of cardiovascular issue, whether it's atherosclerosis or something else of that nature. Maybe I'm just paranoid. Or it could be that I'm not paranoid, and someone else in my shoes would go to an ER immediately. I don't really know what to think, and I don't want to insist on getting a bunch of tests done if nothing is wrong. I don't always fully trust my own perception on these things, to be honest. Anyway, does it make sense to see a doctor about my concerns?
",symptomsthrowaway,,,,0,,,False,t3_1xzntp,True,False,,,1392482988.0,False,verified-doc,,0.0,t1_cfg4zln,Physician,1432411502.0,True,False,1,0,0,t5_2xtuc,t3_1xzntp,False,"1) Hearing/feeling your own pulse is normal. As long as it's not very fast (lets say about 100 bpm or more) or irregular I wouldn't worry too much about it.


2) Slightly cramped calves can be explained by many things. Maybe you did something the day before that your calves weren't so used too? Maybe you slept in an awkward position? Maybe they just felt that way because you focused on it, but perhaps they just were a little sore or nothing was wrong?


3) I don't know exactly what you mean by ""go numb"". Did you lose all sensation? Just some pricking? It can also be completely normal to lose a bit of sensation or feel some pricking of the skin if you're out in the cold and doing work, especially if you are a little out of shape.


4) It's probably not your ears popping, but your temporomandibular joint (TMJ) popping. This is also normal.


5) Well, we all have a little atherosclerosis. It starts from when we're young and progresses gradually. How fast it progresses and if we're ever going to have a cardiovascular event like a heart attack, stroke, aneurysm or something is up to genetics, lifestyle and some other factors. You're young, so even though your lifestyle isn't the healthiest, it's very unlikely that you have for example peripheral arterial disease that's causing numbness in your hands.


6) So does it make sense to see doctor because of this? Yes and no. There is no way I can give you a good answer to that just from the internet. I haven't examined you and done a proper history, I'm just writing my opinion and suggestions to what your symptoms might be related to. Personally I don't think any of your symptoms are very worrisome. However, if you feel like you need to see a doctor, go see a doctor.

The TNM-system is one method of staging. Another is anatomic stage/clinical stage/prognostic stage (whatever you call it) - it is a way of grouping the different TNM-stages into 4 different stages (with a and b sub-classifications).


A tumor that was locally extended into the liver, with no spread to local lymph nodes but with cells in the outer layer of the lung would be T4-N0-M1 in the TNM-system. The lung is considered a distant organ, and that's why it would be called M1 for metastasis. That would be equivalent to anatomic stage IVb. 


The same tumor, but without spread to the lungs would be T4-N0-M0, which would be equivalent to anatomic stage IIIa.

The incidence of death from anaphylactic shock is 1-2/100.000. The NNT for preventing one rheumatic fever in a developed country is 200.000 (because antibiotics are approximately 50% effective for preventing rheumatic fever). This means that for each rheumatic fever we prevent, we will cause 2 deaths from anaphylactic shock and 20-100 anaphylactic reactions.

So it started off on my arm, and i thought it was ringworm. I do highschool wrestling so it's not uncommon to obtain ringworm. I went to the doctors on friday, and he said it was empetigo which i still wasn't too worried about. He prescribed cephalexin 500mg 2 capsule's 2 times a day. And it made my empetigo on my arm start to go away a little/shrink. On thursday friday i noticed a few bumps on my forhead but i thought they were pimples. On saturday and into sunday it got a lot worse. Also on saturday i noticed my lymph nodes enlarged a little. On monday i went to the doctor and he took a culture sample (I think that's what it's called) and prescribed doxycycline hyclate 1 capsule 100mg twice a day in addition to the cephalexin. I had terrible headaches saturday-tuesday. They really lightened up today though which is great. The doctor said since i've been on the new antibiotic for less than 48 hours it's good that it hasn't spread and it's now not contagious. The culture sample should be in tomorrow to see if there's another antibiotic that will work better. Anyways, I normally wouldn't flip out about this but i have a state tournament on friday afternoon-saturday for wrestling and if i can't wrestle i'll be extremely crushed. It was great news that it's not contagious because i wouldn't want to give this to anyone else through spreading it on the wrestling mats/skin contact. But the other coaches might question it so i can always get a doctors note that says it's not contagious but even if i do, they might throw me out of the tournament because ""it looks bad"". So please reddit, i ask for some advice on what to do. How can i make it look not as bad? I heard it's bad to pop the blister like things filled with fluid, so i haven't been. I also heard it might help to apply warm to it to help it drain or something? Some of it's dried up like a scab. Is there any type of cream that would lighten it up?

Modern concepts indicate that cases like yours already have target-organ damage, as you show with the neuropathy.

Second, the neuropathy will only truly improve with long term control of your glycemic status and metabolic (B12, for example) stability. Unfortunately, everything else is palliative until then.
Third, there are nice therapeutic options you could try, **upon talking to your doctor** (of course), like duloxetine - but they should be tried long term to reach any improvement. Another option, but only as a last resort, could be the use of a sleep inducing medication (like a diazepine, for example) just so the consequences of the neuropathy are minimized.

Remember, you are not out of options, but the only real solution is hard work and discipline to achieve metabolic control.

Number one is that it's not proven to be helpful for anything other than just reducing the lab values in young otherwise healthy people. So it does not reduce your risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, death or other diseases. So what are we treating then? We're not treating or preventing a disease, we're just treating numbers.


Number two is of course side effects. Usually statins are well tolerated, but like all medications, there's a risk of side effects, and some are potentially dangerous. If we treat enough people (and we are going to treat a lot of people if we're just going to treat based on lab values), someone is bound to have a rare serious/lethal side effect. Are you going to be that person? Probably not, but we can never know for sure.  Just google ""statin side effects"" if you're interested in seeing a list of them. 


I don't want to scare you, because statins are considered very safe drugs and usually there's no problem with them, I just want to show you that it's not as simple as just giving a medicine to fix a problem.

Occasional alcohol use and cigar smoking(once or twice a month for both), used to smoke marijuana. Family history on my mothers side of heart disease, heart attacks in both grandparents on that side and my grandpa died of it when he was in his 50s or 60 or something, though my grandma lived to the ripe old age of 93, finally succumbing to cancer.

I'm currently in Health 101, and was reading the chapter on cardiovascular disease. The section on angina reminded me of two occurrences in chest pain over the past year, and since I have the family history of heart problems, figured I should pay attention to that more then I have been.

The first time, back in June, I was just sitting in a work training session, taking notes, and I got a pain in my chest. It was most painful when I inhaled, the more full my lungs were the more painful it was. I took shallower breaths, didn't say anything, and it went away in about ten minutes.

The second time, just a couple weeks ago, I had the same pain upon waking up. I was laying down, and getting up made it hurt more, as did taking deep breaths, so I just took shallow breaths and the pain subsided within 5 or 10 minutes.

Does any doctor know what this possibly could be? Is it a lung issue or a heart issue?

I went from 230 to 182lbs in 4 weeks. I saw my doctor twice during the 4 week span, it worried her at the time.

5 years ago I had these red painful bumps appear on my left neck, it is still there and painful once a month. 3 years ago a pilonidal cyst appeared.

I haven't actually seen any doctor since the stint 7 years ago. The reason is my fear of needles. 

My last visit she asked for a blood sample, I went fully knowing I would pass out like every other time. However this time just before i passed out i felt an extreme pain in my chest, honestly the only way i can describe it was when my lung collapsed after falling off a hill, when i awoke i had doctors standing all around me. My heart had stopped. They were freaking out, they put me on some kind of monitor and what not. They made a note to my doctor, but i never returned.

I had to have a filling done a year after that incident, i warned them i would pass out. That same painful feeling happened, and when i came to they were on the phone with 911 and freaking out. They said they couldn't feel a pulse, on staff nurse did cpr and called 911.

I need help, and i don't know where else to go. I don't fear death, but i certainly wouldn't want another person to think they caused my passing.

This constant pain in my stomach, the cyst, and my neck are all becoming too much. It's a rotation of pain cycles every month. The cyst is large enough i would be put under to have it removed. If i can't even take a needle for freezing, how in the hell would i survive any duration with an IV.

I pretty much just always feel like I have to go.

So I went to the doctor. Urine test came up negative for UTI, which was the obvious suspicion. Then was a blood test. Blood test came up normal. I don't have diabetes.

The weird thing is that i'm not really experiencing pain. There has been once or twice when there's been *mild* burning while I urinate. There's also been once or twice when I've felt a very dull ache in my lower back, the right side. But again, this was once or twice over the course of three weeks.

There's no blood, discharge, fever, or shivers.

So I went to see a Urologist. He confirmed its not prostate related.
It's also not that my bladder isn't emptying fully.

Next week i'm going to get my kidney checked but chances are, its not that. If it was, i should be experiencing quite a bit of pain.

Anyway, in my mind I feel like i'm running out of reasonable things it could be. The only thing i can find is Interstitial Cystitis. This seems weird because I'm male, 21 years old, and I'm not experiencing bladder pain.

I just feel like my symptoms don't really align with anything.

Oh also, one of the weirdest things about it is that I feel like I had it about a year ago, too. Except it only lasted for a couple days. I remember having to pee into a cup in my room because otherwise i'd have to wake up so much during the night. But again there was no pain.

My pain was a 7/10, but after pressing my back against a wall and using a tennis ball and Comcast remote, I was able to reduce the pain significantly to a 1/10. I can also feel a band of muscle in that area. The pain started 7months ago at it's worse but has been a 2/10 for 6months and even less now, but I still feel a kink.

I'm afraid of Lung Cancer or Pancreatic cancer. Also my nails are clubbed, but looking at old pictures they seem to have been that way since elementary, but in real time I know they've been this way since I was 17. Can anyone confirm it is infact clubbing?

Im male, 22yrs old, 5'9, 211, African American

I've been had allergies all my life and would get skin rashes on the back of my knee that would be dry and scaly. 

In 10th grade I developed chronic hives and went for allergy test twice and was told I was allergic to wheat and Dairy but I remember the percentages being low. The second time they said I was making too many red blood cells but nothing more was made of it. This was over 5yrs ago. 

Thanks for answers in advance :)

Cancer has other commemoratives and in your age the cell types and locations should be typical. Relax, really.

Vitamin D is sun. Just that. Not even taking it in medication form helps, so go out, see the world and wait for the magic.

As for the bowels, you should start eating better. Really, I am in Brazil and wouldn't be very helpful in specifics, but here some yogurts come with living lactobacillus that help with the job.

And as for your ""plumbings""... Sorry being so direct, but... Have you tried going a week without having sex or fapping? The ejaculation keeps ""weak""?

We have protocols for presumptive treatment of STDs here in Brazil, so detailed exams are really overkill and money down the drain...  

I can't say your doc is good or bad, 20 years in this field taught me that medicine is way beyond the science, it is more about cultivating human relations with your patient and making sure info goes around...

About 45 minutes ago, I started having a sharp chest pain that kind of came and went in waves, sometimes longer and sometimes for shorter periods. I don't have any other symptoms of a heart attack and I don't smoke, don't have high cholesterol, no history of heart attack in the family (as far as I know), and I am relatively healthy, exercise daily or once every other day. Yesterday I did my upper body workout, so could it be muscle strain from that?

This kind of pain happens occasionally (I'd say once every few weeks, maybe even monthly) and happens on both the right side and left side of my chest.

You have many features that favor another cause than a heart attack. E.g. 20 year old, healthy, non-smoker, regular exercise, sharp pain, pain that happens occasionally/repeating pain. You have one symptom that favor heart attack: chest pain. ",t3_201zmh,3.0,AskDocs,lilleboff,cfz3f7z,1394472628,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,201zmh
