He has multiple broken ribs, dislocated hips and a multitude of other internal injuries. He was found at the scene, unconscious with pupils fixed and dilated. In emergency he was declared to have a Glasgow coma scale score of 3. After emergency he had surgery where they removed the top and front of his skull to accommodate the rising intercranial pressure. However, his ICP has been tracking upward steadily from 24 or so up to 90 (not sure what the numbers mean, but I know higher is bad), while his Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP) is down to 25 (from my research, I know this is VERY, VERY bad)... My laymen description is that ""he's all fucked up"". 

I would like to know 2 things;

1. What is the worst TBI you have ever seen a patient recover from (I mean survive, discounting brain damage)

2. In this particular case, what are my brother's chances of survival? And what is your predicted time frame? 

Please be honest with me docs. I am here to answer other questions you may have to the best of my ability.

UPDATE 1: We have spoken with the doctors and according to their experience the doctors were able to confirm that my brother will not survive his injuries. Unfortunately they were unable to overcome the ICP and keep his perfusion pressure high enough. His blood flow to the brain is negligible at this point, but another scan must be performed tomorrow to legally confirm brain death.  ",,,,,,

My wife came home late from work and she was acting weird. She wasn't answering the questions I am asking and instead she was saying stuff that doesn't make sense. I asked if she had anything to drink but couldn't get any answers. I went to bed but couldn't sleep. A couple hours later I heard some noise from the living room. She had opened the windows and saying it's so lovely out there and a new day is about to begin. She had this cheering tone in her voice. Then she proceeded to the apartment door to leave. She was saying she has to walk in this beautiful day and cannot stay indoors. That's where I tried to stop her. She started fighting with me. I was literally begging her to stop but she got away anyways. I couldn't follow her because our 2 yr old daughter was sleeping and I couldn't risk leaving her behind. She did not come home and I was sick worried. I called the police and they found her 2 hours later in a park nearby. She wasn't herself and wasn't answering any questions. Now, we are in the hospital and she doesn't recognize me or our daughter. Attending doctor is coming shortly and will perform an assessment. As I sit here in the hospital room, I am beyond worried because this is the first time this kind of stuff is happening in our 8+ year marriage.
She was having hard time at work and was stressed in the last few days but it wasn't too unusual for the to be busy. I am very worried and scared. What is happening to her? I tried Googling stuff but was very limited with a crappy cell phone, I decided to type this out to Reddit.


Also, since I am on my cell and English is not my first language, I left some stuff out but nothing major.

She was only taking the Propranalol before she was diagnosed with cancer on march 21st.

I have noticed in the past 3 days that she has been doing some weird things. It started out with her unwrapping period pads and tearing them apart. She has started to throw full toilet paper rolls in the toilet, and last night I found a candle in there. To my dismay I keep having to put my hand in the dirty toilet water to get them out of there. She isn't flushing anymore, either. She has surgery on april 8th to have her bladder removed and to have an ileal conduit in place of it.
She is also opening bottles of soda and leftovers and throwing them in the sink. I don't know why she is doing these things because she won't answer me. For example, I sat her down to eat lunch with me and she kept getting up to do things. I will ask her what she is doing and she won't answer. I keep asking and she gets mad at me but still won't answer me. I also can't do the bills because she won't tell me how to do them and I've never done bills online before. Her bills are late and I'm just frustrated and a little scared about what's going on. I don't know how to handle this situation any longer.

I probably forgot other things she is doing, but I hope this makes sense. my thoughts are scrambled cause lack of sleep so it might not make sense, I am sorry.

I am a 20 y/o female Caucasian. I have experienced PTSD and panic attacks for the past 5 years, but it is not serious. 

The panic attacks I have most are caused by flashbacks of lucid dreams (I have lucid dreams almost every night it's great!) while I am awake and about my regular business. They occur mostly in the summer when I am doing my exercise rounds at the bayou. I would have a lucid dream that I've previously had during sleep enter my conscious mind without my permission. Then I would be questioning my surroundings, whether what I am experiencing is real or not, or if my surroundings are real. Then I would get confused, and experience symptoms of anxiety, which, if I do not bring down myself, would result in a panic attack, where the world around me feels as it is transforming into something unreal, and my heart would race crazy-like and pupils do something and my whole body feels high. 


So. I know how to control it for the most part, but my question is... How do these lucid dreams force their way into my conscious mind? And why do I feel like I am actually in an adventure in the fjord as a wolf with my wolf buddies instead of the hot summer of southern US? 


Thanks for your time!

*Edit*** these dreams are really quite pleasant and adventurous, it's just that they interrupt my real-life adventures. Sometimes it is a flashback to a random event (usually never unpleasant) or the feeling of deja vu.

Ex. At McDonald's ordering a tasty cheeseburger, which I do rarely. But wait, have I been in this same situation with the same exact people serving me? THis is weird. Ahhh confusion. Ahhhh silent panic attack ",,,,,,

My wife was driving down to Texas (recently relocated for work) when someone ran through a stop sign t boning her car.

She was wearing her seat belt but it snapped/tore/whatever and she was ejected from the car.

Broken ribs, some of her lower spine is fractured (can move extremedies so doesn't look too bad) but her lungs may have bruising. One lung collapsed. Road rash obviously.

She's pretty heavily sedated but has shake/nod her head to answer questions and gestures with her hands (mitten things on her hands)

I'm told it can take 3 to 5 days for lung bruises to show up. They did some kind of scope thing in her lung and removed mucus and didn't see much bruising. Warned it may take a few days though. What I've read online really scares me.

I suppose I'm wonderimg what you guys think her chances are. She is an ex smoker (stopped 1.5 years ago but sneaks the occasional CIG) and is overweight.

No one wants to give me an answer here and I'm guessing with what little you have to go with you won't be able to either.

I suppose mainly I want to vent. I lost my younger brother to suicide in 2007 and was able to get through that telling myself it was his choice. Well this wasn't her choice. Our son just turned one today and we were supposed to be celebrating in our new apt.

Even after i shower, it will start smelling rather soon with out peeing or masturbating so its not dirt build up. Even before after doing those things, the smell was NOTHING like this weird smell. Its almost like rancid fish. So it has nothing to do with my hygiene. Its nothing like my typical body odour or what it normally smells like down there.
Around my pubic area smells perfect fine, that unique body smell that my penis used to have, but now i cant even stand the smell of my penis if i leave it for too long and its driving me insane. I first assumed it might of been because i had slept with some girl so i went and got checked for STI's but they came back all clean. Got checked for thrush, clean. UTI, clean. The doctors just give the typical ""make sure you shower daily"" and it kills me inside thinking theres nothing that can be done. I shower twice a day and it will still smell bad after a hour or so. Many of the doctors i have seen seem clueless to what the cause could be.

I started googling online and read something about saying tonsil stones could cause odours from body parts. I have been getting tonsil stones for a few years now. I saw a doctor in the uk to see if i could get them removed when i first started getting tonsil stones but was told NHS only removed tonsils if you have repeated tonsillitis as tonsil stones arn't seen as a real health problem worth fixing. Though it certainly affects my self esteem and social anxiety. Since then my tonsils have become much worse. Here is a few pics of how my tonsils look currently. http://imgur.com/a/O8ZTT
My tonsils have horrible large crypts and i suffer from bad breath thanks to them.

Then a few months ago, my hair and ears and the wax inside of them also started smelling very unclean. Not just the typical body smell, but a really unhygienic rancid smell. I thought i might have caught an ear infection so got tested, all clean and the doctor kept telling me how there seems to be nothing wrong when he inspected it.

This is all driving me pretty depressed. But was thinking, could my tonsil stones be causing the bad smells in my penis and my hair/ears? The article i read online said how the body can start to absorb the tonsil stones or something and get excreted through sweat or else where in the body.

Or is that completely out of the question? I have no clue what could be causing these strange smells. My father and sister can smell the hair and ears as well and agree that its very strange that the doctors are clueless or don't seem to care.

Its causing me to become very depressed, i can't meet new people or leave the house because i am too ashamed of it. If it isn't the tonsils what else could it be ?
If you are able to help id be ever so grateful, thanks.",,,,,,

My brother is on a seafood processing boat in Alaska. The boat received some fresh meat, as it were. One of the new guys asked my brother for some advice because he is experiencing some weird symptoms and wants some peace of mind. My brother sent me an email asking for help, as he has limited time and money to use the Internet where he is. I did some preliminary research, but am coming up empty handed. My brother's narrative is as follows. 

""Rob is a 28 y/o male with no significant medical history. He is about 6'2"" and 190 lbs. He has never been hospitalized, has no chronic medical conditions, takes no medications. He does report a history of substance abuse and dependence but has not used drugs in years. He never used IV. He drinks socially and smokes. **(NOTE: Alcohol is neither allowed nor available on the boat.)** His family medical history is largely unknown. Rob came aboard the boat about one week ago after being transferred from a land plant in Seward, AK, where he worked packing caviar, he did not perform strenuous labor at that facility. Currently he works in the plate freezer area. This involves moderately strenuous and repetitive activity for 16 hours daily.

On the 19th he presented to me complaining of bilateral erythematous discoloration of the superficial anterior vasculature of his forearms (see photos). He reports the discoloration is progressing medially and began while in Seward. He denies pain, urticaria, tenderness. The vasculature is palpatable and is not warm to the touch. It is not petechiae or purpura. He denies fever, body aches. No episodes of lost consciousness. It should be noted the surrounding erythema is the result of a mild freezer burn from a few days ago. The vein discoloration is not related to this incident. This is not a rash, it is coming from the inside. The skin is intact and not sloughing off.

Unknown if related is the recent development of swollen tarsal joints in the morning that is partially relieved once work is started (lots of people have this issue. It is tendinitis and some arthritis). What is interesting is that his tarsal joints seen to be crooked sometimes- he says that has never happened before.

No one else in the factory has reported anything similar.""

Impingement syndrome / rotator cuff sprain.  It was my first visit for the issue.

I got a steroid injection, physical therapy orders, and he told me he was going to prescribe a cream.  He said it's for general muscle relief.  I said, ""like tiger balm?"" and he replied ""no, this is a prescription drug, it's medicated"".  He said I can't pick it up at a pharmacy and that his pharmacy will mail it to me.  I thought this was a little strange.

That pharmacy called me a day later and asked for my insurance information.  I gave it to them and asked for the name of the drug so I could research what it was (I was a little skepical/suspicious at this point that the doctor was trying to sell me something).  The lady at the pharmacy said it's ""just orthopedic cream"" .. that's it.  It has no name.  I'm puzzled at this point.

Today, a few days later, I get a package in the mail, it's my cream.  I call the pharmacy and tell them I did not ask for this and that I did not want it.  I hadn't opened the package yet and asked her ""is there a bill inside?  I never paid for this and do not intend to"".. and she said ""I don't know, open it and see.  You don't have to pay for it if you don't want to"".   She later asked me if doctor put me in a research program for the drug.  Excuse me, what?

The bottle had an Rx label on it, but no drug names, no information sheet, no warnings.   Sure enough, it just says ""orthopedic cream"".  It says it's a compound drug.  I did some research and found that compound drugs are a legitimate thing, though not regulated by the FDA.  So at least I now know why it has no name.  But I also found that doctors should only prescribe compound drugs custom tailored to the patient's specific needs.  This was not the case, it was a very generic offer in the doctor's office.  He just said (paraphrasing) ""I'll write you up for a prescription for a cream, it's great for soreness and muscle pain"".  

Am I reading into this too much or does something sound really fishy about this?

Doctor tells me it's a prescription.  I didn't pay a copay.  I didn't have to pay for the medicine, nor do they care if I do.  My doctor had to call it in and have it shipped to me.  Pharmacy asks me if I'm in a research program.  No description of the drugs inside the ""compound"".  I'm at a loss.  Nothing about any of this is adding up.

I had called my Doc's PA the morning of my fall and left a voicemail for her.  I explained that it hurt pretty bad, that the nerves were going crazy, and that I felt like it had pulled apart somewhat.  I followed this up with a text message a bit later and finally spoke with her some time after 1PM.  I went further into detail with her, answered her questions about the presence of leaking fluids (which I couldn't answer conclusively), and then suggested that I had an appointment later that day with the VA Primary Care Doc.  Was told she wouldn't know what the wound would look like.  I was ok with that, but I was still going to see if she saw something obvious.  Anyhow, the gist of that is the PA told me to wait until I was scheduled to see the Doc 5 days later on July 30th.  She didn't seem concerned.

July 30th appointment is the first one I was having directly with my Doctor in a while, and of course the first one since my fall.  I had my bandage removed by a nurse and waited for him to come in.  When he did, [he took one look](http://i.imgur.com/baJ56Bs) then asked me ""Have you been up more than you should?""  I found that to be an odd question.  I had been told to return to normal activity last Thursday, then fell on Friday and reported that to his staff.  So, that's kind of how I responded: ""Not really.  In fact, I've been down a lot more since the fall.""  Before I even finished getting ""fall"" out of my mouth, the stoic surgeon's face became a bit pallid and he turned toward me with his eyes a little wider than usual.  I was given the impression that he was not made aware that I had fallen and contacted his own PA about said fall 5 days earlier.  I let him know exactly what I told the PA, he asked why I didn't come in immediately, I told him what I was told by his PA, and we wrapped up the conversation with him scolding me to be more direct and bold when contacting his staff in need of assistance.

It is left alone for the next 3 appointments (every other day) until this last appointment, August 6th.  This time, the PA is seeing me for the first time since the fall.  I had felt she might have gotten in trouble for not informing the doctor, but apparently she was back in his good graces.  She sits down and kinda looks aghast at the [wound](http://i.imgur.com/fktqnFQ).  

She starts playing a bit coy, asking me if this was from the first fall when I talked to her or the second.  I was immediately put on guard by this.  I never have fallen again, and I definitely never told anyone that I had.  That's what I told her at this time.  She then continues like this: ""Well, what about when you called Alex on Monday?""  What?  I didn't call anyone on Monday.  I did call Tuesday night and spoke with the Doc because I was running a fever, having a hard time breathing, and was in a lot of pain.  When I made that call, I thought he knew about the fall.  He kinda brushed me off, so again I thought nothing of their instructions or of my injury.  He did at least tell me to come in at 8AM the next day, July 30th.  

The probings continued like this for a few more minutes.  It felt to me like she had gotten into trouble and was either trying to find out what I told the Doc or try to redirect the blame from herself entirely.  I was very forceful and direct by letting her know that this was from the fall I called her about, that I thought she should have had me come in immediately and apparently the doctor did as well, and that I didn't take kindly to her not-so-subtle shifty questions and in some cases flat out lies.

So, with all of that and the pictures of the wound (the last one being the most current), would it be wise for me to get a second opinion from another ortho doc or perhaps a wound care specialist?  Seeing this wound immediately [after I fell on it](http://i.imgur.com/7jWYiSm), could a doctor perhaps have done something more to prevent [this?](http://i.imgur.com/fktqnFQ)

My question is: what's the best way to report a doctor and have him investigated for running a pill mill? 

I figured doctors would know the protocol, so I'm asking this here. In case you're wondering why I'd make such an allegation, I've provided a bit of background below. Thank you for your time.


I visited a doctor about a year ago to establish myself as a patient. I had no health problems, and I was only there because my family's physician had moved and I had to find a new GP. The actual visit with him lasted five minutes only and at the end he handed me a prescription for both Percocet and Vicodin with refills. I immediately gave it back and found another doctor, for I had explicitly told him I did not have any kind of pain when he'd asked. 

I live in a small community in HI, and I've noticed changes in many of my friends who are his patients. They've become lethargic, withdrawn, and out of shape.

A member of my household is also seeing this doctor and I've noticed tremendous physical and emotional changes in this person while they have been under the doctor's care as well, about 18 months. I discovered today that this household member had been prescribed (by said doctor) an outrageous amount of narcotics: 6 pills a day of 5mg oxycodone - 350mg acetaminophen tablets, to be taken every day and refilled each month. This person's medical record states they've had a long history of pill addiction (oxycodone) as well as myasthenia gravis (not sure if that's a relevant condition, but I'm including it because I suspect it may be). This is what compels me, above all, to report this doctor. 

So, what can I do? This seems horribly illegal and unethical to me. I fear for the wellbeing of my friend and for the well-being of my community.",,,,,,

Sex: Male

Height: 5'10''

Weight: 121 lbs

Race: White

Duration of Complaint: 5 days

Location: Lower abdomen, perineum, penis

Existing issues: Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Somatization Disorder

Current Medications: Bactrim, Ciprofloxacin, Clonazepam, Cefdinir

Current vitals: Temp: 97.2, BP 117/65, HR 60-90 at rest (normally just 60)



I recently had a cystoscopy to diagnose some microscopic (intermittently macroscopic) hematuria. Results showed BPH and some inflammation between bladder and prostate (or like touching the two). The doctor presumed it was prostatitis and prescribed bactrim.

The next day I got a 103 fever with a 110 average heart rate.  They promptly started treating me with Rocephin IV and some tylenol/motrin to get my fever down. The next day my fever came right back toward the end of the day and they prescribed Cefdinir to take by pill, while continuing to figure out what's going on with the urine. 

Urine culture comes back: Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. Likely prostatitis as well but this is a urinary tract infection. Doctor also believes I had transient bacteremia. All the tests were negative except white blood cell count showing 22000. I was having pain in my lower back and when I flexed my kegel muscles and a bit while urinating, but I don't seem to have urinary obstruction.

They prescribed ciprofloxacin because that's one of the things it was sensitive against, and everything else was IV/IM only.

I took that for a day and a half before what seems to be developing tendon issues. I told them I didn't want to be on cipro anymore because it feels like it's going to make me a cripple. Two days after stopping it now and I feel like I cannot run. 

My temperature/heartrate have been stable and lower the last few days but the doctors are urging me to take something. 

They sent out another urine culture to see if Suprax will be effective against pseudomonas, and are recommending me take that in the meantime while that comes back, with the risk that the pseudomonas infection could progress. 

What do I do in this situation? It seems impossible. 

One problem we're having is that I have GAD and known somatization disorder so they're not convinced the Cipro is causing the symptoms I'm feeling but I'm convinced. They don't know how to prove whether it's one way or the other without an achilles tendon biopsy but they believe that's it's own mess that isn't worth getting into.

TL/DR – My ex-wife’s “friend” is a General Practitioner and he is writing Doctor’s Notes for the kids because she doesn’t take them to school and lets them sit around the house doing nothing all day.


My ex-wife is a pill popping, near-do-well who used to work at a Doctor’s Office doing check ins. We have 50-50 custody of the 2 kids, and she has a horrible habit of not taking the kids to school or bringing them in tardy. It has gotten to the point where we had to go meet with the school Administrators because they were threatening to send us to Juvenile Court over the number of unexcused absences and tardies. NONE of these have taken place on my weeks (I have gone back with their log and the custody schedule to validate this).


Well what has happened now is that she will keep the kids home when they don’t feel like going or she doesn’t feel like getting out of bed, then she will go to her old boss and have him wrote them a note. School is happy because all they really want is the absence to be excused (the teachers are NOT happy because they want the kids to be there to learn).


Do I have any recourse? I am thinking I might call him up and have a chat and explain that if he does this again I will file a complaint with the AMA. I don’t want to, but I have tried everything to get her to grow up and be a responsible parent and she simply will not listen to me. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I am at my wits end.

This is rather strange.  It's almost about half an inch of tightly packed strands of hair.  There are a lot of them, but there's never any visible root.  I don't have to yank this hair out either.  It isn't attached.  It just eventually slides out of my navel with the cotton swab.

I was recently diagnosed with an ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm at the beginning of the summer.  The aneurysm is concurrent with a bicuspid valve.  When I was originally diagnosed, I was told I would have to watch my heart rate and blood pressure, and while I could go back to exercising I could never go as intense as I have been.  I was also told to avoid other activities which may increase heart rate, such as roller coasters.  When I asked about an operation, the doctor told me that, while the surgery would replace my valve and bring my aorta basically back to square one and has a 2% mishap rate, he wouldn't recommend it until it grew to an alarming size (I think mine is currently at about a 4.5 mm).

Recently, I've had something extremely irritating happening with my eyes, and I'm starting to worry. Whenever I'd look at something, a white, lowly opaque wave would overwhelm my vision. The best way to describe what I see is by comparing it to seeing through dirty glasses, with fingerprint stains on the lens (these ""stains"" move around, though, similarly to how floaters would). If I were to have my eyes flicker toward one direction now, for instance, a tint of white would rush across my field of vision after a few milliseconds, and eventually move away. 

Also, this only occurs in my left eye. If I'd cover it, keep my right one open and look around, my vision wouldn't be affected by any whiteness.

It's also worth mentioning that this wave of whiteness is most prominent when looking at an area where two objects highly contrast in brightness. If I were to look at a dark surface, and immediately shift my focus to an area that's bright (e.g., a computer screen), a white wave would just LAYER my entire vision. Sometimes, I'd have to resist the instinct to flinch. Yes, it's that bad. 

I will seek help as soon as possible, but I very much want to have a brief idea of what may be happening.

Many, many thanks to those who can help :)

I've had pretty bad acne for years and years and because of it I stayed inside a lot. A real lot. I think I stayed inside for about 4 years without going outside at all, even for 5 minutes.

Over that time my acne got worse and worse and I started developing other symptoms such as allergic reactions to foods containing fat. Whenever I'd eat anything with fat in it I'd get a red rash around my nose that would last for 2-3 days.

Eventually it got worse and worse and I realized that I might be deficient in Vitamin D so I took supplements and the rash stopped appearing and my acne got a bit better. I believe this is because vitamin D has an anti-inflammatory effect and stops the immune system from over-reacting.

However, my acne was still a problem and having tried various creams I went to a dermatologist and she gave me some antibiotics to try. 

So I start taking them and I notice strange symptoms like my nose turning red again and my whole face would get really red at night and would feel like it was burning. My nose also started running whenever I ate anything (literally I'd eat a banana and 1 minute later my nose would start running). My right hand also turned red and started swelling up and getting sore, sort of like arthritis.

So I went to the doctor and told her all my symptoms and she ran a test (general test and inflammation test) and she said everything was fine and didn't know what was causing my problems.

After taking the antibiotics for 5 months (which didn't help my acne at all), I stopped taking them. I read online you should take probiotics after you finish a course of antibiotics so I ate a probiotic yogurt every day for 2-3 weeks.

It's now been over a month since I stopped taking the antibiotics. Here's my symptoms now:

- My face is still turning red all the time for no reason. The left side of my face has a permanent red patch.

- My legs have red patches all over them which disappear randomly every 5-6 hours and then come back.

- My right hand still is red compared to my left hand and is stiff/hurts to move my fingers a bit.

- I get small red hives/spots all over my arms/hands whenever I go outside (photo sensitivity probably)

- My skin is peeling off on my right hand (also my nose sometimes as well). Literally my skin is falling off in patches.

- My nose STILL turns red whenever I eat anything with too much fat in it (which I try to avoid). Meat for example will make my nose turn red the next day. Probably the worst symptom. I don't know of anyone who has this.

- I still have acne and my skin is SUPER oily

- I have to pee all the time.

- My tongue is literally yellow. I also get yellow patches of skin all over my face. I think it's some sort of fungal infection but idk what to do about it.

What the hell am I supposed to do? I try to eat healthy, avoid fat, get out in the sun for vitamin D, exercise, drink probiotic yogurt drinks...what else can I do? I feel like staying inside for 4 years has destroyed my immune system and now I'm fucked. I've tried all kinds of supplements...zinc, vitamin A/C/D/E, fish oil and others.

My doctor doesn't have a clue what's wrong with me, my dermatologist is useless and wants to give me more antibiotics for my acne. I asked her about my face/nose turning red and she just shrugged.

Honestly I've been dealing with this crap for years and I can't take it much longer. I have to avoid people because I look like total shit. I can't live a normal life like this. I have no friends at all and I have absolutely nothing left to live for. I feel utterly hopeless.

I doubt anyone has any idea what I should do but I might as well post this as I'm out of options and won't be around much longer if I don't start getting better.

Thanks to anyone who even bothered to read this.",,,,,,

I was diagnosed with Chiari Malformation Type 1 several years 

ago. 

Yesterday I was in a car accident. I hit a concrete barrier head on. I was fine to be honest. My neck and shoulder hurt like mad but I figured that was normal after what had happened. Just a little bit ago I started feeling dizzy when turning my head. How important is it to be seen by a doctor? It is super expensive to go to an ER and if I can avoid it, I will. 

I figured it may be normal to have these issues since I already suffer from Chiari Malformation. Can I just sleep it off? Ice packs? Heat? 

Please tell me what you think. I know many will call me stupid for not having gone to the ER yet but please consider that a lot of people in the US just cannot afford it. It can cost thousands even with insurance. This is why I ask. 

Please don't insult me, if possible. I am just asking because I want to avoid paying for medical bills for years. Thank you for any advice you can give me :)

I literally joined to ask this question. I have a specific situation with a friend who is a total hypochondriac. She always thinks something is seriously wrong with her when she is mildly ill. But she insists that she is not a hypochondriac.

Right now she actually has an infection with a rare bacterium (ureaplasma). It started about 7 months ago. She's received several courses of antibiotics and nothing has worked. She says the doctors told her that there was ""no way"" she could have this infection after the first treatment, even when they had positive test results in front of them. She's complained that they've been very condescending to her and insinuating that she's just looking for pills. (Do patients even try to hoard antibiotics? Is that a thing? I thought it was just painkillers.)

I'm worried that she's shooting herself in the foot the way she approaches medical professionals with her attitude that there's always something seriously wrong with her and they're failing to fix it. I'm concerned she might alienate her and that she'll receive worse care. Of course the issue here is that she actually *is* right this time, and this infection is not responding well to treatment.

I've tried gently reminding her that her doctor has many, many years of training and to try and be patient despite her frustration (this infection has been going on for months. but she refuses to believe she could possibly be part of the problem. Any advice?",,,,,,

* Bloating after eating, especially when food has higher sugar content (porridge with added honey, yogurt).
* Pain in stomach area, especially after eating. 
* Reduced appetite. Not greatly reduced, but definitely some reduction. 
* Intermittent appearance of hives, about once per month. Sometimes they have covered her entire body. Local doctor said likely food reaction, but was not sure. 

Blood tests were done on the basics. Most things came up normal, but several were abnormal, without a clearly related pattern (for us). Abnormal blood results as follows:

I wasn't diagnosed but my symptoms clearly say plantar fascitis. What is the best way to relieve my pain other than rest? I can't seem to rest my feet cause there's always somewhere I gotta go to few times a week.

I've always worn flat shoes and am a little over weight for my height. I am aware I have this weird posture when I'm standing where my left foot is firm against the surface I'm standing on while the other foot isn't (as firm etc etc). I've been trying to consciously shift this habit and put my weight towards the right side instead, or try to distribute my weight on both feet but being very gentle towards my left.

Just recently, I had to sit down for a few minutes after a long walk and when I was ready to go, the pain trying to walk was just so bad that I had to hold on to the nearby chair for support. It wasn't so bad for the past couple of months but this time got me worried so I'm seeking help.

I know the number one suggestion for plantar fascitis is rest, but what if I really had to go to some place and walk a lot every now and then? Will footwear with a little bit of height (heels) make my condition better? Any form of stretching? Exercise?

I've been sick since Friday (March 28), with what I believe to be a viral infection/flu. I've had stuffy nose, congestion, chills, headaches, fever (around 102 at one point), very sore throat, and swollen glands in my neck. I already went to the doctor yesterday and he said it's not strep, and he's pretty sure it's a viral infection. However, today I noticed a very weird symptom that I've never had before that's concerning me. I noticed that I have little spots on my fingertip of my right hand's middle finger, and the same type of spot appears on my left hand's pointer, but much smaller. I tried everything to get it off from regular washing/scrubbing to rubbing alcohol, but nothing works. It seems that the spots may be under my skin. I read on some online forums and one suggested that it may have to do with low platelet count and the capillaries bursting, but I'm not so sure. It's a bit worrying, so if there's anything you guys can tell me or point me in the right direction then that would be greatly appreciated. Also, the only symptoms from the viral infection that I believe I had that are still present are the very sore, red throat (it hurts to swallow) and the congestion, with coughing and a stuffy nose. I've always been pretty tired but that seems like it would be a regular thing that comes with being sick.

Let me try this again so you lot have more information. I have developed a plethora of symptoms and I think might potentially be the result of neural problems. I know this stuff is the realm of a neurologist (am seeing one soon) but in the interest of second opinions I considered someone around here might have other ideas. 

I'm a 26 years old male, 5' 9"", and 163 lbs. No medications currently (except for Ativan since I had a panic attack last night.. trying to not take it). I'm causaian, have no history of neuro disorders in my family. I had struggled with social anxieties most of my life, but very little depression except for at times. I have used cannabis, heavy user and times but often just moderately and rather variable in frequency. Slowly my symptoms have been developing for the last 4-6 months. The neurological problems started some 2-4 weeks ago. 


* Started with odd stretchy and stabby pains in my body, sometimes a dull pain in my calfs. The feeling like certain parts of my body weren't healing from exercise easily.
* What felt like nerve pain in my arms, mostly in the elbow (often the pit) and some dull pain in my tendon that was exacerbated by computer use
* More recently, as of 2-3 weeks ago or a little longer, I noticed that parts of my vision and body were tremoring slightly
* Now, a lot of my movement is starting to feel jerky and involuntary
* I am having trouble balancing and I feel wobbly in my posture
* There's a pressure in my head on the right side, just a rather odd light pressure that never goes away. My right eye vision is much more blurry that normal.
* Both ears feel like there's a pressure to them slightly, and when I yawn sometimes I feel a slight relief. The doc last night at the hospital (had a panic attack..) noticed my right ear was competely clogged
* For the past 2-3 weeks my appetite is practically non-existent. I've been forcing myself to eat food and pretty much nothing tastes good.
* My tongue moves erratically a bit when I stick it out
* My mind feels a bit foggy, like a slight cognitive deficit.. sometimes hard to recall things but I don't feel terribly dumb yet either. 
* I have a weird sensation like I can feel my blood pumping a lot. Especially on the left side of my head, above the ear. It pulsates, like some kind of pumping. I had noticed this pumping feeling in many other places in my body too. Like my veins/arteries are ""pumping hard"", but doctor's lab work comes back like everything's normal.. BP too.
* I find myself losing track of what i'm doing and a little more forgetful
* My blood pressure is normal when checked, so is BG, and the typical labwork done at the hospital when I went appeared absolutely perfect. Everything within normal range.
* Antinuclear antibodies are normal, sedimentary rate is normal range, and creatine kinase is also normal (had these checked some month or so ago before my neurological symptoms appeared).
* My CT scan yesterday looked fine, but when my doctor's office called back they said there was potential ""cortical shrinkage"". When I had a panic attack last night, the staff at the hospital were a bit pissed they told me this. I think they were angry because it scared me and I thought myself into a panic attack last night. At the hospital I probably horrified everyone in the waiting room.. Feel okay now though and I have Ativan in a bottle for when I need it.
* I was given a Lyme test, but it was just the ELISA and not a western blot test to go with it.. This is obviously not very reliable, but based on my symptoms it doesn't strike me as likely to be lyme.


Based on all of what's going on.. I kind of feel like the ""cortical shrinkage"" is probably ""cortical atrophy"" and I pretty much have a neurodegenerative problem. I'm trying to cope but it's a struggle waiting for my neurologist appointment, and I couldn't convince anyone to schedule a MRI until then.

All physiological symptoms of the high occur including dilated pupils, dry mouth, as well as the usual sensations of physical pleasure and mental speed-up. When the highs wore off I would be left with intense anxiety and, sometimes, panic attacks.

I saw a doctor who prescribed Diazepam which helped with the anxiety but did nothing to stop the highs. I continued for two months, my general ability to think and perceive decreasing with every episode, the lows getting lower until I could barely read or follow a conversation. Recently, however, the lows do not occur. I have been high for ten days and my mind and body are giving up - I am experiencing constant vertigo and I feel almost claustrophobic as I am always disorientated and disconnected. My short-term memory is terrible, and I often forget what I am doing, what I have just said in a conversation and how I come to hold objects or where objects go to be put away.

I subsequently saw an endocrinologist, who took many blood tests that returned normale, and then a psychiatrist. The psych prescribed Valporate/Depakote first, but as I took the medication the highs became more frequent and intense over the course of a week. Valporate was discontinued, then I was given Quetiapine/Seroquel. A single 25mg dose of Quetiapine induced an extremely intense MDMA high 30 minutes after taking it, and the psychiatrist decided to discontinue the treatment immediately. The psych has now referred me for an MRI scan and to speak to a neurologist.

I doubt anyone here is specialist enough to give any ideas, but I'm looking to spread my story around in the rare chance of catching someone's eye who may have an idea/interest in this case. I'm open to any wild theories, too, as several doctors have conceded that neither they nor their peers have every heard of such a case. There is a time consideration on the issue, too, as in the past ten days my abilities have degraded so considerably that I feel in another ten days I will be unable to communicate properly.

As a note, I have no history of psychological disorders and my psych evaluation was determined to be normal, aside from the anxiety.

However, the pressure in my breasts hurt. And, frankly, I felt terrible just pumping and wasting the milk. I know my husband had always been interested in my breast milk. I figured it wouldn't hurt to let him suck some out and satisfy his curiousity and kill 2 birds. It felt great for me and my husband was happy and enjoyed it, too. Apparently, he liked the taste. Within the day, he asked to try again. I obliged. I realized I was just emptying my breasts which would mean more milk production. But it was very relieving and I felt like the milk was being put to better use than throwing it out.

The only thing was that this continued the next day, and the next and so on. I stay at home and my husband also works from home. It was extremely easy just to ask hubby to help drain my breasts. He was happy to bury his face in my breasts and drink the milk; he enjoyed the taste of it. It also felt great for me because it felt like I was giving him something really nutritious to eat; that I was providing for him (just like he provides for me-it's a partnership).

Now this has been going on a few months. He drinks from me multiple times a day. I'm sure I'm producing much over a litre a day, maybe upwards of 2. He drinks all he can and I'm happy to oblige. It makes up a significant part of his diet. He says he feels completely healthy and has no complaints.

My question is, is this unhealthy for either of us? Should we reduce or stop this? I can't find any concrete health reasons, but I know this isn't 'natural' or normal. So, I'd love insight.

(For the record, we are healthy, disease-free in our early thrities)

I've been experiencing continuous rectal discharge since the last week of May. I barely see anything when I wipe- i.e., it's a clear liquid (no feces) and it's not plenty enough to stain clothes- but it comes out continuously throughout the day. I had a colonoscopy to figure out what's wrong and they found I had non-specific colitis, a hyperplastic polyp (that was removed), and hemorrhoids, but none of which were determined to be the cause of the continuous discharge. My colorectal surgeon referred me to a gastroenterologist who gave me probiotics for two weeks (S. Boulardii) but that only cleared up my severe cystic acne and did nothing for the discharge. He then prescribed me Pentasa suppositories, but I reacted adversely on the 7th suppository (weak, body hurt, chills, hot eyes, slight fever, vomiting) so I stopped taking that. He reassessed my case by watching the colonoscopy video himself and determined that the inflammation along the colon was quite mild; the most noticeable area of inflammation was at the terminal ileum, although this did not seem bad enough to warrant further use of anti-inflammatories or an endoscopy to probe the small intestine.

Since the discharge started, I've had a bitter taste in my mouth whenever I have a hard time digesting food (e.g., tough meat). I also had an episode of severe diarrhea (~15 explosive, liquid bowel movements in 16hrs) that led to an increase in the rectal discharge, a new cystic acne breakout, and abdominal pain, particularly when eating fiber (bloating). I have drastically reduced my fiber and carbohydrate intake since then.

Aside from the colonoscopy, I also had a routine stool test and stool culture/sensitivity done, as well as blood work to test for the following: creatinine, SGPT, SGOT, ALP, total protein/albumin/globulin, bilirubin, FBS, ESR, CBC, and thyroid hormones T3, T4, TSH. All the results were normal.

I am just taking supplements for now (i.e., l-glutamine, zinc, and Custom Probiotics' CP-1) since my doctors have no idea what is causing my discharge. I hope someone can help. Thank you.",,,,,,

I've always had an extremely severe anxiety disorder (GAD) and that sort of caused MDD.  Anyway, I'm much better now (yay psychotropic drugs) but my friend is not.

(17/M)  He has no hope in anything, feels lonely a lot but can't be compelled to talk to anyone.  Feels empty, hopeless, doesn't care about anyone or anything, numb.  Has been this way for about 8 months, as far as I can remember.  Other things he says include stuff like personal hygiene, getting out of bed or showering is an effort.

No self harm (that I know of)

Having been there myself, *I* think he's depressed but obviously I'm not a professional.  The thing is though, no matter what I say, either from personal experience, or just general common sense, I just can't convince him to talk to anyone but me because he doesn't like talking to people, especially about these things (he's very shy).

This all culminated in me telling him my little testimony thing, where basically I said I used to be in a state where I either had to make an active effort to get better or kill myself.  There were no other options, I couldn't stand feeling so hopeless and having 3-4 panic attacks a day, which was exhausting.  And so I told him I started in little steps.  Goal one, shower two days in a row.  etc etc, on to how much I improved once I went on medication and started regularly seeing someone.

I tried to tell him it wasn't easy, that the first day is the hardest, and yes there will be backtracks.

But his self-worth is so low that he doesn't care enough to do anything about it, and both of his parents are quite cold and clinical, and he refuses point blank to talk to them about anything.

I'm just looking for some guidance here.  I feel absolutely helpless just sticking by him.  I needed my friends to give me some tough love and start resenting me before I started to fight, but I don't want to be hard on him in case I make it worse, being his only friend and all.

Just anyone, give me an answer besides just 'be there for him.'  There has to be something.   ",,,,,,

Hey /r/AskDocs, I was hoping someone could shed some light on something that happened to me Monday afternoon.  I'm sorry about the wall of text that's about to follow.

I was coming back from lunch with a friend, and as soon as I stepped off the the bus, I began to feel a bit sick.  I figured I was just tired from not getting much sleep the night before, and decided to put off my errands for a quick nap.  I remember entering my apartment and then walking into my bedroom, but I have no memory of lying down on the bed.  It was like I suddenly blacked out, and when I regained consciousness, it was like I woke up in hell.  I didn't know where I was; it felt like I was in another realm entirely.  I saw colors swirling around me, like I was on a carousel that had gone out of control.  There were about ten different voices in my head at once, and I couldn't figure out which thoughts were my own.  My heart was pounding, I had a loud ringing in my ears, and I couldn't swallow.  My muscles were so tight I couldn't move.  Once I finally figured out where I was and could make out the numbers on the clock, about 45 minutes has passed since I had gotten home.  When I finally stood up, my equilibrium was so off I couldn't walk without holding the walls.  My vision was blurred, and whenever I tried to focus it was like my eyes would drift off by themselves.  I felt slightly nauseous, but that came in waves.  My heartbeat was still out of control.  It took about six hours to get back to a functional level, my vision was still blurred but I was walking okay.  My heartbeat was still pounding and the ringing in my ears had not gone down.  My throat was still very tight.  My SO got home from work close to midnight when I told him what happened, the first thing he did was try to get me to eat.  My nausea was gone but I had no appetite, and the soup he gave me seemed to have no taste.  I barely slept that night because the ringing in my ears kept me up, plus I would snap awake every time I tried to swallow. Not much had improved by the morning so we went to Immediate Care (I haven't yet found a doctor in my new city).  I told him my symptoms, he said it could be a panic attack but he wasn't sure, that I had a strange variety of symptoms.  The only thing that worried them was my pulse, my heart was still out of control.  They hooked me up to a machine to monitor my heart rate and said it was going down slowly.  There were no real answers, I probably should have gone to a hospital but all I wanted to do was lie down at that point.  It took more than 24 hours for my symptoms to vanish, and 48 hours for my heartbeat to get back to normal.  I've never had a panic attack before, is that really what this was?  Why did it last so long?  It was completely out of the blue, I just want to be able to prevent it from happening again.",,,,,,

I also had severe issues with what I termed adrenaline, leading to sinus tachy, palpitations, and precipitating panic attacks.  Intermittant.  Increases after alcohol consumption (&gt;4 hours after drinking).  

I suddenly began experiencing palpitations again this past week and intermittent sinus tachy.  2 days ago I have palpitations constantly and yesterday my heart rate was completely erratic.  I used a HRM to count calories and while preparing for a walk it shot from 86 to 192 down to 146 down to 90 etc.  I assumed the HRM had a low battery but began feeling my heart actually speeding up and slowing down.

ER admission I was awaiting blood test results and while in the bed I felt like I had an adrenaline rush or some sort of strange sensation that immediately led to an increase in heart rate.  I yelled for the doctor and they put the EKG on me but before they could push adenosine my heart started going back down to sinus.  For the next two hours it would increase randomly and then rest around 110-120 bpm when not shooting up to 140-160.

They got the EKG and said it was clearly SVT.  My mag levels were low so they pushed 2g and lopressor 25 mg po.  After about an hour my pulse went down to the 80's and I was discharged with instructions to meet with a cardiologist to receive a referral to an EP.

I am on metoprolol 50mg i po bid,  it seems to be working fine though when it begins to wear off I feel sinus tachy again.

Clearly I have a great deal of anxiety about this.  Most resources I see indicate it isn't much of a serious condition but more of a disturbing set of symptoms.  I have no idea how that would possibly be accurate based on what happened last night.

What should I know about this?  Am I going to die?

Left Ankle, Outside


So Since birth, I've had a large mole on the outside of my Left ankle, and when I say large, I'm not talking size-of-a-dime, I'm talking size of a Loonie (Canadian 1 dollar coin) which is roughly an inch in diameter. See below. As far as irregularities, there aren't really any. Again see below. Regardless, about four or five years back we went to a doctor in another town, I don't remember what kind of doctor he was, possibly pediatrician? He recommended it be removed, obviously, but as an alternative he said it would be possible to do what he called a ""shave biopsy"" wherein they slice off the top layer of the Mole and test it for cancers and such. I was (and still am) terrified of surgery/operations, having never needed any, and having a phobia of anything medical. Likewise, I opted for the Shave as opposed to removal. They did the biopsy and the results said that the mole was benign, so off we went and I had to endure frequently changing the bandage on the sucker as it bled a lot. Time has gone by and what we expected would happen was that when it healed, it would just be a pink scar. Instead, it came back, almost exactly as it had been before. Round, Dark brown and smooth. Although now it's ever so slightly raised (perhaps scar tissue?). In the last four or five years, it really hasn't changed much at all. At least not enough for me to notice. That being said, I recently began to wonder whether it was possible it could still be a threat, and around the same time I started to notice (maybe?) a dull ache in the area. I'm trying to convince myself it's just a sort of nocebo effect brought on simply by thinking about it to much, and that it's not anything to worry about. That I'm just being paranoid. That being said, it never hurts to ask a professional, just in case. That and it would put my mind to rest - at least, that is, if it IS benign.

It's been over three years since my son (super cool kid, doesn't complain, silly, blue eyes, likes dragons, Star Wars, and teasing his sisters) began displaying symptoms, and we still don't have a diagnosis. Do you guys have any ideas?

He was a happy go-lucky little boy with normal development until age five when he began showing difficulty keeping up with his peers on the playground, with handwriting, and with extreme fatigue. After school he would often come home, sleep until dinner time, when we'd wake him to eat, and then he'd go right back to sleep until the next morning.

He now sees a neurologist, the only ped neuro in our state, but we still have no diagnosis. 

The little dude:
8 yo Male
Caucasian
76 lbs 
4'9
Medications: Gabapentin 400-500 mg per day, taken before bed. Concerta 27 mg per day in the morning

Symptoms present since 5 yrs old
 
Symptoms:
Chronic headaches, ADHD, parasthesia, fatigue, insomnia, RLS, weakness, eczema, normal cognitive skills, but he is developmentally delayed in his fine and gross motor skills by 2-3 years, and has intermittent pain in his hands and legs, some sensory issues, intermittent vision problems, eye pain, neck pain. He has been very depressed lately. He appears generally physically weak, and has a sort of clumsy gait when walking. Most pronounced is the appearance of his hands which seem almost babyish compared to his peers. Test preformed by his occupational therapist indicate he is in the 4th percentile for strength, coordination, etc. 

He has had two MRI's of his brain and spine, with the only remarkable finding being a 2-5 mm in diameter syrinx in his cervical spine from C4-C7. I was told the syrinx was likely an incidental finding and wouldn't account for his symptoms. He also has some ""minor thickening of the bone"" in his lower spine. They have ruled out tether cord syndrome, chiari malformation, spina bifida and all of his blood work comes back normal, and it doesn't appear to be MS, and muscular dystrophy seems to fit, but most of the symptoms he has are different--i.e., his hands were affected first. 

His doc says the next step is a muscle biopsy sometime in the next year year, as well as another MRI in that same time frame. My concern is that he is getting weaker, and we could potentially be doing more than treating symptoms, but without a diagnosis, there's no treatment.  I don't know if I should push him to work harder physically or if that is just causing more pain and damage for him. What if this disease is irreversible and it's something he could be treated for now? What if it's fatal and I'm wasting precious time with him at medical facilities!?
 

Thanks in advance for any help!  I sometimes wish there were an IRL version of House I could take him to see.

So this little girl, K, was a normal girl. She grew up normally, developed normally, had friends and a great social life, and even learned how to play the piano on her own at the age of 5. When K was 6, she developed a fever and her temperature was said to be incredibly high. Her parents took her to the hospital, but the nurses neglected to place her in a room or give her any attention until a couple of hours later. By then, she passed out and I believe she was placed in a coma. After she woke up, she was no longer the intelligent little girl that her parents knew. She could no longer walk, no longer move, no longer talk, and no longer had any bladder control. Her parents chose to not place charges against the hospital for negligence. 
After years of therapy, she was able to walk and move around. Now she's 13, and she wears diapers even though her parents have tried to potty train her again. She cannot talk to have a conversation, but she is aware of when she needs her diaper changed and she does understand when we tell her to come eat. For example, when she needs to have her diaper changed, she would constantly repeat ""Diaper. Diaper. Diaper."" over and over again until it's changed. She laughs when anything she finds funny happens (like when I trip over something or when her mom makes a funny face at her) and she knows how to operate the iPad to watch children's nursery songs on YouTube. She walks and runs with her back bent forward, exactly like how Genie the feral child does. 

I feel as if she is aware of everything that is going on and understands everything that we say, but she just doesn't know how to communicate back to us that she understands. She has been going to school like normal, but when I give her a pencil and paper, she slouches away from the pencil in disgust.
Can anyone here explain to me what exactly happened from when she was hit with the fever to the results? Did the fever cause her to have brain or neural damage? I am just curious as to what happened in the hospital that caused a developmental reversal such as this.",,,,,,

Both images taken within a week of one another.  

I do have hypothyroid, is it just a side effect of that?  

I've always noticed my face to have largely noticeable difference sometimes for several days at a time (at least to me, maybe i'm just over analyzing myself).  It is much worse in the mornings like shown in the first image, but my face will be slightly puffy for a few days at a time throughout the day.  My entire face seems to swell; lips, area around eyes, cheeks, area beneath jaw line.

Hello,

The symptoms started last summer. It was predominantly trouble breathing at first, and diffuse pain in my chest/left arms/jaw/back then and nausea. After a few days of daily massage with a camphor cream, the pain disappeared. I would conclude it was some entangled nerves or something. I decided not to consult a doctor even though that impression of breathlessness persisted. The symptoms above actually lasted a few hours at most and I experienced about 3 of these episodes per day. Then, the symptoms magically disappeared at the end of the summer, except for nausea, which lasted another few months until I stop eating dairy products (possible lactose intolerance?). I had a few episodes of breathlessness in November/December, but they would usually disappear quickly. I guess at this point I concluded it was merely stress. In February, I started to have a pain similar to my chest pain, but in my left knee. It is similar in the way the pain comes and goes quickly, I feel it ""rise"" and it lingers for a few seconds before disappearing. I also noticed the same pain in the lower part of the ribcage. Just like for chest pain, I don't necessarily have to move to experience it. 

Anyway, about a month ago, I was in the shower when I started feeling incredibly weak, it felt like I couldn't quite catch my breath and my vision started turning black. I checked my pulse after the incident: it was normal again, but within the hour, the trouble breathing/pinching sensation in my heart started to become more and more unpleasant, and I started to feel a tingling sensation in my hands. I called 911, the doctor told me it was probably just a panic attack but considering how thin I am, he finally told me to drive to the hospital for some tests. So, I ended up having a EKG, a complete blood panel as well as a lung radiography and everything turned out to be normal, so they told me to go home. Following that, I had many intense episodes during which I thought I was dying, but as I previously said they usually last an hour or so. Now it's been two days I feel considerably worse in the sense the chest and back pain and breathlessness don't go away anymore. I haven't even been able to sleep more than a few hours here and there. I'm quite worried about my health, but don't really want to go at the ER again for 'nothing'. Do you think it presents an emergency? 

Thanks for reading, and for possible advice.

Any ideas on what to have our doctors look into would be greatly appreciated.


My wife has been experiencing these symptoms for many years, but in the past 2 years they have become significantly worse in both frequency and intensity.  We have seen several doctors but they all are at a loss and seem very unconcerned since none of her symptoms are particularly terrible - however, they are pretty drastically affecting her daily life.  If anyone has any idea about things to look into and ask her doctor about, we would be forever grateful.


She's 27, 5'3"", 120 lbs.  White, southern california, no current diagnosed issues and no medication.  Up until this last year, when she hasn't been able to because of symptoms, she was very active.  Gym 2x/week, and she dances and choreographs for a living.  She still choreographs and is fairly active despite her difficulties, but less so than before.



**Symptoms:**

* Numbness in fingers, nose, and lips when active or resting (comes and goes, but happens a few times a week and can last all day)
* Feeling faint and dizzy (but has not actually fainted) when active or resting
* Shortness of breath
* Irregular heartbeats (she says it feels like it pauses, and then ""ker-thumps"")
* Extremely tired and fatigued (about 80% of the time)
* Frequently losing her balance when active or resting (she says she feels like she loses her balance sometimes when she's sitting or laying down, which is odd)
* Feeling ""hazy"" in her body
* Heartbeat often slow when she's physically active or very fast when she's resting
* Though she is often sleepy, she sometimes has trouble sleeping through the night or falling asleep - takes melatonin or Zzzquil on occasion, which helps.  Maybe 2x a week for the past 2 months. Not sure if relevant.
* Very frequent muscle twitches - especially in left eye and in fingers



**Things the doctors have checked:**

* Basic blood work - she's not anemic, her electrolytes are normal, not diabetic, and anything else that would come up in that test was normal.  Vitamins B and D were good.
* They gave her an event heart monitor for a month - the doctor thought there may be a structural issue with her heart.  She recorded several episodes but they all were deemed normal and not a heart problem.  
* Heart echo (ultrasound) - normal 
* EKG and stress test - monitored her heart at rest and on the treadmill, normal
* blood pressure, heart rate and breath rate are all within normal range - we have a blood pressure doodad at home and tracked it throughout the day for a couple months, as well as checking at every doctor visit - all normal
* MRI to check for seizures or unusual brain stuff, normal
* given anxiety medication by the neurologist that did not help, went to see a psychologist who did not think she was anxious or had any other mental issue
* tried cutting caffeine from her diet, eating very healthy, doctor had suggested more salt in her diet (?) so we tried that for a while, she drinks plenty of water every day, and keeps her sleep schedule regular (though often so tired/fatigued that she naps during the day as well)



Does anyone have any suggestions about things to look into at this point?  We don't know what else to ask the doctors about, and none of our friends and acquaintances have any ideas.




Thank you so much.



* Not sure if relevant - she and her twin were born very early, given steroids before even born to fully develop their lungs.  Both her brother and her sister have asthma, though she was never diagnosed with it.

It's driving me nuts.

In truth, there's no phone up there, the buzzing is just like a phone. Actually, closer to one of those TENS units a PT would use. It starts every 15 seconds, comes on gradually, buzzes hard for about three seconds, and then lays off. The sensation is inside my anus, approximately where I'd imagine my sphincter to be. This occurs all day, no matter what position I'm in, for the last two weeks. Even while I'm sleeping.

I thought it might be a hemorrhoid. I've never had one before. But no bleeding, no itching, not really any problems with pooping. I am going a little more frequently, I think because of the extra stimulation down there, but not having any trouble with it. I tried a suppository, eating high fiber and prep H -- no change.

My next theory is that it's related to my back. I have a history of back problems. Bulging l4/l5 + annular tear. Sometimes it acts up. Currently I do not have any back pain or sciatica. But perhaps this is a nerve issue that is somehow related? Traction and my typical back exercises have had no effect.

* Any thoughts on what it is?
* Should I bother going to a doctor? [I am fully insured, but my doctor usually just shrugs his shoulders at random crap like this.]

Thanks!

*edit:* Okay, the buzzing was driving me insane today so I made a doctor's appointment and went. The doctor literally had zero idea what it could be, had never heard of anything like it, and said that it would probably maybe just go away in a few weeks. 

SIGH. Once again, doctors are great if you're bleeding out on the table, but if you have something minor wrong with your body that might lead you to eventually off yourself, they really don't give a shit.

I guess going to a colon specialist is my next move. Do they have colon specialists?",,,,,,

My wife is 25, has an under active thyroid which she takes medicine for, as well as panic attacks, anxiety, and depression which she takes medication for. None of her medications, or dosings have changed in more than a year.

Anyway it started yesterday, my wife was napping on the couch when a family member came and got me because she had crawled in the floor. I arrived and honestly thought it was some kind of sleep walking, and laughed it off until she started throwing punches. Once I finally got her eyes open she acted confused, but I eventually got her back to the couch. Her head flopped over onto my shoulder and she was out like a light instantly. I went back to thinking it was just a sleep walking thing when she slid in the floor and starting thrashing. I immediately thought seizure and told my family to call 911. She's never had seizures before. 

After her first bout of shaking she woke up and held my hand....they she said she could feel another attack coming on and went stiff....after that was over I told her to concentrate on me...and when she felt another coming I would talk to her and she could fight it off...I could actually feel her tensing and Untensing as she stopped the shaking fits. 

The ambulance arrived.....at this point she was tired and could barely walk, but once we arrived at the hospital she was fine again. They ran tests and found nothing, the ER Doc barely spoke english, only examined her for about 10 seconds then said no seizure and left. A med student came in....I told him the story...he shrugged and left.....and then they discharged her. She felt tired, but fine all today and most of today...

Now this evening. 

She was fine and we decided to see a movie, halfway up the steps in the theater she said she was was getting tired...and made a joke that she was out of shape. By the time she got to her seat she was completely out of breath and falling asleep. I got her back to the car and she didn't want to go back to the ER because they wouldn't do anything anyway, so we came home and she went to sleep. After about four hours sleep she woke up and came downstairs to where I was sitting...she was once again out of breath and tired just from the walk, but otherwise felt fine. 

She just went back to bed saying she'd sleep it off. 

I'm at a loss here.......with it being memorial day weekend any reputable doctor within driving distance is out of the office, and all our local ER ever does is shrug and send people home. (My father is older and in failing health....we have a lot of experience there.) 

I know this is a wall of text...and thank you to anyone who read it, but I have no idea how to help or where to get it....any suggestions would be awesome.

 A few months ago, i began getting these really severe headaches. I normally do not get headaches or migraines and these just seem off to me. They are very sharp, come completely randomly and last only seconds. Sometimes there is a faint ache for a few minutes afterwards. I have dropped things before because it is so sudden and painful. 

Anywho, i felt that it was strange so i went to my doctor, who didnt seem to concerned with it, but ordered a CT scan anyways because she said it was pretty simple and covered by my insurance completely. 
Today the results said that there was a 9mm , what they think is, meningioma. She told me that it is a benign tumor and not a big deal because it was so small and wasnt causing symptoms.  She ordered an MRI to confirm that that is indeed a meningioma tumor. 

I understand that it is tiny, but i guess i am a bit confused as to why she doesnt feel like the headaches are serious symptoms. Is this something that would be discussed with me more in detail by the specialist when i go to get the MRI? Is it just assumed that its not going to need to be removed because it is so small? She said to monitor it, what if it gets a tiny bit bigger? then does it need to get removed?

I know. these are things i should have asked her. I was just kind of in a really weird daze after she told me. Like i was expecting her to tell me im crazy and theres nothing wrong with my brain. Yet there it is. this tiny little thing that is about 9mm larger than i think it should be. ",,,,,,

I was at work, not doing anything physically demanding, and then I was struck with palpitations. I've dealt with palpitations, that usually go away within 10-20 seconds, but this time it was different. 

The palpitations struck, and we're consistent for at least a minute or so. I panicked, and was close to telling someone to call 911, but I got some water, and kept my breathing up, so eventually it stopped. But it left shook, and actually a little weak, and full of anxiety. 

Since then, I have had a tightness in my chest, sometimes a slight pain, and shortness of breath. I feel like it much harder to get full breaths, and also my nasal passages have been dry and plugged up much more than usual (may be allergies). I also experience random spurts of palpitations more frequently than I have before. I have stopped drinking caffeine since then, because it makes me really anxious. I used to be able to drink a lot of caffeine, and would be just fine. 

I work outside, doing construction and landscaping work, and I also lift weights 2-3 days a week. Usually when I lift weights and work, I'm fine, and don't have a serious issue. But times like today, I was at the gym, and my heart was beating really hard and fast, and afterwards I was left with anxiety, and my heart felt like it was skipping a beat every so often. I'm currently still trying to relax myself. 

I plan on calling to set up a doctors appointment tomorrow, but I wanted to know if this seems like it could be something wrong with my heart, or if it's just my anxiety worsening. It's all very stressful, and scary.

When I do vomit it is usually just bile. Sometimes I will try to eat to calm my stomach but the food just makes it worse and I vomit anyway (on these occasions I'm eating more than just bread).

There's no discernible pattern to it all. I never eat or drink the same things the day before it happens. Sometimes I will be getting less sleep in the days preceding it, some days more, so I don't believe it is related to my sleep patterns. It also happens regardless of where I'm sleeping e.g. home, school, friend's house. Sometimes it will happen (either the vomiting or the morning nausea) just once a month, other times much more.

I'm a 20 year old male. I am 6 ft tall. Middle Eastern descent. Born and raised in the USA. I'm around 210 pounds currently, but when it started I was probably closer to 190 if not 180.

Hi there--I am a 22 year-old female and haven't gotten a period in 2.5 years, and I'm concerned this means I could possibly be infertile. My access to healthcare and talking to a doctor is a bit limited right now, so while I wait, I've come to post on Reddit and a few other health forums to see if anyone's had similar issues or if any doctors/health professionals might have some answers. Any feedback or insight at all would be very appreciated!
 
Just to provide some background on the issue:

My period stopped in the winter of 2011 and hasn't come back since. This had coincided with the start of an eating disorder (anorexia nervosa), which I know often triggers the loss of periods. At the beginning of winter 2011, I'd weighed around 145 lbs (I'm 5'5"", so this was a BMI of 24.1). By August 2012, I weighed 95 lbs (BMI = 15.8). The weight loss was mainly driven by an extreme reduction in calorie intake, but toward the end there began to be slightly excessive exercise as well. The period stopped just around the same time I began eating less (December 2011).
 
In September 2012 I saw a doctor, was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, and went into IOP treatment for it. My weight went back up to around 110-115 lbs, and my health issues regarding things like low calcium, osteopenia, hair loss, low blood pressure, etc., for the most part improved. Throughout all this time, though, the period never returned.

At this point, I am much healthier as my eating and exercise habits have improved and are for the most part healthy. I have been maintaining my weight around 105-110 lbs, I no longer restrict or purge, and I've been eating enough calories with a normal level of exercise. But I'm very concerned that the history of the ED has or may cause me to be infertile. I'd asked my doctors about the missing periods at the time of the ED treatment and they'd explained periods can stop due to things like fast weight loss, increased anxiety, etc., and that they return once a healthy weight and normal eating habits are restored. However, mine has still not come back.

If anyone has dealt with this before or knows more about testing for infertility or bringing periods back, I'd really appreciate the insight.

This is an embarassing question for me. I am new here so I hope I have the right subreddit for this. 

Several years ago my neurologist, while running tests trying to figure out why I have daily migraines, decided to check testosterone free for whatever reason. It was about 330, just a few points below baseline (348-1197) for the labcorp test. But it was something he was concerned about nonetheless and told me to see my general practicitioner and a urologist. Fast forward a few months and I am on Testim gel around the age of 22 and I eventually go on to androderm because it was more convient. 

I continue this regimine until I am 24 years old and see an endocrinologist to check my hormones. She does a battery of tests. I wish I had the results in front of me. The important thing is that after being on testosterone treatment from age 22-24, my testosterone free measurement only went up to a max of about 360 points. Now this is a bummer because this is only 12 points above baseline, but technically considered healthy. She took me off the testosterone and all my other hormones related were well within range. And yes, I know there is a raging debate in fitness circles and other places about how testosterone in the 300s is still considered low by some people, and I tend to agree with it.

Now, about 9 months later, I get a checkup with a dermatologist 2 weeks ago who, for whatever reason, decides to check my testosterone free and T3 levels. My T3 levels were perfect but my Testosterone Free was 214... As soon as I heard that number my heart sunk because it had never once been below 300, much less close to being 200.

I'm extremely worried about this for several reasons. I am suffering from what I could only guess is penile shrinkage. This has been noticeable for about a year, but it became a problem when nurses were trying to get a catheter in me and explained to the doctor how difficult it was. All I could do is sit there an try not to cry like a baby. 

And it is like nothing I have ever seen before honestly. I have always been normal sized (I'm circumsized), but now it has shrunk so much the foreskin extends past the head of the penis. As if the head of the penis has itself retracted into my body. 

Now, from what I have read on the internet, people who are only high doses of propranolol also suffer from a similar issue of penis shrinkage. Has anyone else had a similar experience with this medication?

I don't know what to do. I'm starting graduate school and I turn down dates because I don't want them to find out about this. The earliest I can see my endocrinologist and urologist both are two weeks from now to get answers from professionals.

But until then, I wanted to know if anyone else has had to deal with a similar issue, whether it was medicine related, a testosterone problem, or just born like it. I just want to be normal again and I already have severe anxiety and depression that I see a therapist and psychiatrist for.

I appreciate any help you can offer. It would help calm my nerves knowing as much information as I could. Also I apologize if I didn't do this correctly or didn't do the title correctly.

Picture is taken from below, looking up.

I took this a MRI scan of my brain a couple of years ago. The reason for it was that I overheard a colleague describe some symptoms of cerebral palsy, which her daughter is suffering from. I recognized some of these symptoms, and went to the doctor to have it checked out. I was already 26 at the time, but never had this looked at before. 

I have been experiencing impaired balance and coordination in the right side of my body (I'm left handed, by the way), as well as slightly impaired vision and very slightly impaired hearing on the same side for as long as I can remember. I never thought there could be something physically wrong with me, but that I just happened to be this way. After the scan, the doctors told me my balance and coordination problems as well as some tenseness in the muscles could be attributed to this damage. My vision, hearing or cognitive functioning should not be affected by it. Is this true? 

My main question is, when does something like this happen to the brain? As far as I know I've been the same way for all my life. Does it occur before or after birth? What specifically causes it, and can it get worse?",,,,,,

My feet were quickly soaked, numb with cold (didn't feel warm until the next morning) and remained sodden for a good few hours that night. For about 5 days afterwards I would have a pins-and-needles type feeling for a few seconds whenever I stood up after taking my weight off my feet (by sitting or lying down, also happened if I took my weight off my feet while doing something active, like cycling and swimming). At night I also noticed my soles were really itchy - not a small surface itch like with a bite, but a kind of tingly under-the-skin kind of itch all over. Didn't think much of it at the time, kind of thought it might have been because they had been so cold. 

On Monday I went into my city and got caught in awful weather with bad shoes again. Torrential rain, flooded roads, had to wade through ankle deep water to cross the street... my feet were again soaked through and as I was spending the day out there and it didn't stop raining they remained sodden for several hours again, though this time (it being summer) they weren't cold at all. Now, a few days later, I have had the same pins and needles and itchiness. Have only just remembered that a similar thing happened in February. 

I'm a Dutch female in my early 20s, normal weight, have never had any health issues and I exercise regularly. I have very thick, calloused skin on my feet and have never had a blister, I also tend to get cold hands and feet easily, my feet in particular taking forever to warm up. I've noticed pins and needles in my feet when standing up and the same itchiness at night a few times before while growing up but can't remember whether that was in a similar situation - the two events I spoke about above definitely make me think it has something to do with them getting so soaked for a long period of time while I'm on them but it seems a little ridiculous that getting wet feet causes this! 

I might be worrying about nothing, I tend get worried when my body does strange things like this because I'm not used to having problems/seeing doctors etc. so I freak out at the small things! If anyone can tell me why this might happen, whether it's normal or if it happens to anyone else (none of my friends get it) I would be very grateful :) 

**tl;dr**  Feet get soaked, remain in sodden shoes and socks for a few hours, causes me to get pins and needles and itchiness in feet for days afterwards... why and is this normal?",,,,,,

My mother is 48 years old, has been quite healthy her whole life.  She definitely may have hit some exhaustion over the past two months.  She also took 3 trips to Delhi, India in the past 9 months.

* For about 30 days my mother has had a **terrible time breathing**.
* It got really bad so my dad took her to see a family friend/doctor.
* This doctor concluded there was **fluid in her lungs, ordered an xray**.
* I do not know what the xray showed, all I know is that an ** ultrasound was then ordered**.
* After the ultrasound they removed **fluid from the lungs, the amount was 2 of some unit.**
* Spoke to different doctor who said they should not have removed that much fluid out at once.
* Mother is now coughing intensely and uncontrollably, we were told this is normal after removing the fluid.

...two hours later...

* I get a message from my dad saying they've moved her to the ICU.

Anyone here have any ideas?

Another reason for the spotty info, my parents are both foreign.  I mean, they've been living in this country for 40 years, but nuanced conversation, especially medical is still going to be a little tough for them to relay to me.",,,,,,

Now I am lying on my bed trying to treat myself because he thinks I'm faking it. I am cramping in my lower right rib cage, my throat is sore, and every time I swallow a wave of pain travels down my esophagus. Lastly,  I am salivating a lot and have to make frequent trips to the bathroom to spit. The spit has an abnormally low viscosity (as in it runs like water out of my mouth).

What can I do? I have a car if I need to get supplies. Right now I'm lying down with my feet elevated, which is doing nothing.

What happens is when i breathe out it feels like i can smell/taste cigarette smoke and there's a slight burning like sensation in my throat, it sometimes makes me cough. It varies in how strong it is but it's pretty annoying.

I've no idea what causes it or what it is, any ideas? I've never smoked, but i was around a smoker until i was 18 but i try to avoid smoke as much as possible, it always makes me cough and makes it hard to breathe as it's so strong.

I rarely come into contact with smokers nowadays, this feeling tends to come on when i'm at home - where nobody smokes.

I'm male, 25, Caucasian,  197cm tall, and thin at 90kg. I find I have to urinate quite often, usually with a very sudden and extreme urge. I have noticed that the usual bladder irritants, caffiene, sugar, pop, chocolate, all cause me to have to go more often and suddenly, but even avoiding those only helps a little. I also feel that I don't have as large of a bladder capacity as I should.

I have tried pressing my bladder after voiding, to see if I am not emptying it completely, but this doesn't seem to help. I have also suspected a UTI or other infection although I don't have any other symptoms. Still, I tried including flax and cranberry juice in my diet anyways, but I noticed no changes.

This is not a new issue, but a recent job change has made it much harder to deal with. I also think it is getting worse as I find myself more frequently rushing to the washroom in the morning as well as waking up in the night to pee.

I had a few bladder issues as a kid. I was prone to the odd accident and I was a bed wetter for far longer than I care to admit. The doctor always figured it was because I was a very very skinny, fast growing kid. 

Also, there was one month when I was twelve where I had blood in my urine. I went and got checked out, ultrasound and urine sample, but I don't recall them ever figuring out the cause. The doctor just told me to drink lots of water. Sure enough it went away a few weeks later. His theory was that I got hit in a kidney pretty hard while playing sports, which is plausible.

I haven't been to a doctor about this recently and it will be a little while before I can get in to see one. I'll admit, I'm not someone who's very comfortable with doctors. I shrugged this off as having a small bladder for a long time, but some recent advise from a friend has me think it may be something worse.

So if anyone can tell me what I can expect for tests, what to ask about, and any other advice, that will be greatly appreciated.

It was not my first time, but I hadn't been with anyone else in almost 10 months. I'm not on the pill because truth be told I didn't think I would be sexually active for a while, but I met someone and I'm leaving for college soon so we decided we wanted to make the most of the time we had. I counted my cycle and we used a condom, but when he went to pull out in the end it came off half way out, and we tried to be very careful but there's a chance some could have gotten on the outside of me and there was more fooling around that could have spread it possibly? I'm not sure quite how easy that is to do. I knew I was due to start my period two days later though so I didn't think it would be a big deal, but when my period didn't come I took a plan B just in case, that was on the 28th day of my cycle, meaning I was sexually active on the 26th, though it was past midnight so really it was the 27th, and then again on the 28th, the day I expected my period, but we were much more careful about incidents that time. My cycle is always slightly off schedule, ranging between 26 and 31 days, but today is day 30 and it still isn't here. I'm starting to get a little concerned because I'm about to go on vacation with my family next week and I certainly won't be able to subtly take a pregnancy test, let alone explain why I wouldn't be drinking... I know stress can put your period off so I'm trying not to worry but there's really no way I can be starting a family right now. Is it also possible that I'm off because I was sexually active for the first time in so long? I also hear that Plan B can put your period off a bit but is it normal for it to be off by more than two days because tomorrow will be day 3? Just looking for some honest expertise, I've never had a scare before so I want to make sure I'm asking the right questions. Thanks!",,,,,,
