It feels like a sudden burst of physical (not mental) restlessness or something, or like a weakning of the muscles and it can last anywhere from a minute to maybe fifteen minutes. \\n\\nI've had this every once in a while now and it never really occured to me to ask anyone about it. It's also kind of hard to describe. Would anyone know what I'm talking about?\""
