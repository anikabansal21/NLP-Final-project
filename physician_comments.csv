That said, in general terms, a meningioma is a *100% completely benign* tumor of the lining of the brain or spinal cord. It is absolutely nothing to worry about in terms of it being a ""cancer."" It will not spread, it will not invade tissue, and you will not need chemotherapy for it. The only damage they can do is by physically compressing parts of the brain or spinal cord. 

It is indeed quite possible that a meningioma can compress a small part of the brain and cause headache. It sounds like it is not based on the fact that your doctor is not referring you to a neurosurgeon to have it removed. The only way one can know is by looking at the scan and seeing where it is. In this case we would refer to it as an [incidentaloma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidentaloma) meaning that it was found because of your symptoms but isn't actually causing your symptoms. In that case it is absolutely appropriate to watch and wait. Some meningiomas don't grow or are so slow growing they don't cause problems for years. And nobody wants brain surgery (even something as easy and straightforward as a meningioma resection) for funsies. It will only need to be removed if it actually starts pushing up on your brain. And don't worry. It can totally push up on the brain without causing serious or permanent damage. 

If you are still concerned it is perfectly reasonable to ask your doctor to go over the scan with you and show you exactly where the meningioma is relative to your brain and have him explain what would need to happen in order for them to advise you to get surgery to remove it. It is not an emergency, so schedule it at the convenience of your physician. If (s)he refuses, find another physician. I will *always* go over scans with my patients, *especially* if they request it. 

The rest of what /u/neuropharm115 said is spot on. Headaches can be multifarious. Keep a log of when they happen, how long they last, as detailed a description of them as you can (location: behind the eyes, in the back of the head, stationary, moving, unilateral, bilateral, etc quality: throbbing, dull, sharp, brings tears to your eyes, searing, stabbing, sudden onset, gradual, etc triggers: whatever you did, ate, drank up to 60 minutes before onset other: auras, flavors in your mouth, time of day, *time of month*, other sensations you experience during it like tingling arms, legs, mouth, etc what makes it better or worse)

As for why the headaches themselves aren't serious symptoms - because they are extremely common and you are an otherwise healthy young woman. There are a few red flags we look for and it seems you don't have any of them. Even I could tell that because if you did you wouldn't be writing this right now. It may be something more serious or sinister than just random ass headaches that people get, but it isn't anything that will kill you (or else you'd be dead or in the ICU right now, hence my comment about not being able to Reddit). It could be new onset of migraines. It could be strange seizure activity. It could be menstrual headaches. Or sex headaches. Or cluster headaches. Or trigeminal neuralgia. And on and on and on. But we don't have an objective diagnostic to determine that. Scans and blood tests won't help. So we need you to give us all the pieces over time and then we put it together. Typically that means years of this and going back many times until finally a doctor puts the jigsaw puzzle together. But you can make that a lot shorter by keeping a really accurate (and objective as possible) diary of it. That way we have more pieces sooner and more reliably. It may come down to just lifestyle modifications to help (my uncle, for example cannot drink red wine because it gives him splitting migraines; that started in his late 30's) or there are neurological medications to take for certain kinds of headaches (they aren't perfect and don't always work, but they do help a lot of people) or specific medicine for migraine if that is what it seems to be. 

Anyways, try not to worry too much about it. There is actually a very good chance that before you even have time to get a good diary together all of this will have passed and nobody will have any idea what the hell was going on in the first place. Such is life. 

In the meantime, you've got a few things to do and work on and really nothing to worry about the meningioma. If you have more questions, I'll be happy to answer them as best I can.",0,,t1_chxzcx6

Obviously, too much is not good, but a number is very hard to give. In general, a specific behaviour shouldn't harm the rest of your life. So if you don't get into trouble because you choose to masturbate instead of other things you should be doing or have trouble performing other tasks be cause you constantly have to think about masturbation, you're probably fine.
