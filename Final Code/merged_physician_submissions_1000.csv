It had about 3% Benzyl Alcohol added to it and was filtered through a 0.22nm nylon filter.

The next day, I couldn't walk. I have swelling at the injection site and around/above my knee cap. It's very, very difficult to walk, and the pain is near unbearable if my leg isn't elevated/at level with my body; so I've been near bed ridden for the past 4 days.

Symptoms: Swelling, slight redness at injection site, warmth from injection site, spontaneous (what I can only describe as) muscle spasms; a few times a day, whether going to the bathroom or lying in bed not moving, my quadricep will twitch/spasm. Injection site is very 'tough' and 'hard'; tissue scarring? 

There is no visible abscess. I don't have a fever. No difficulty in breathing or elevated heart rate. No vomiting. My appetite seems a bit suppressed, but could be because of the heat we're experiencing. I did have a nose bleed yesterday but that could've been from my mild hay fever. Tensing my leg is pretty much impossible. Bending my leg at the knee to any acute angle is impossible; feels like my knee and injection site has massive pressure on them. I've been sleeping with my leg slightly elevated, trying to keep off it (probably only spending about 10 minutes on my feet a day).

I've been taking ibuprofen for pain/inflammation but doesn't help.

Basically my two problem areas are at injection site, around upper/outer kneecap (where the quad ends?).

I'll be going to my doctor Monday.


I used a 1.25"" 25g needle, area swabbed with an alcohol prep pad before injection. I inject 4-5ml often (though it's been about 4 months since I injected either of my quads, keeping it to delts, pecs and glutes).

I'm 24 and have been having bowel disturbances for about five months -- frequent (at least 4-6 times/day) bowel movements, bloating and gas every evening, and about once a month or two some light rectal bleeding. Besides bloating dull ache, I feel occasional sharp pain in my lower left abdomen. 

Have done tests to rule out common viral/bacterial infections and ulcerative colitis and tried IBS medicine for a month (not much help). 

Saw bowel specialist who is having me get some blood work and another pathogen test done. He recommended a colonoscopy to check for inflammation.

Now, I'm from the US but currently work in New Zealand and would have to pay for the colonoscopy (about $1500-2000) out of pocket if I get it done here. If I wait until I come home in December, my US insurance would probably cover it.

I'm hoping for advice on any danger there could be in waiting. I guess I've gotten used to the symptoms and have found that changing my diet alleviates them a bit. If symptoms go away, would it be a bad idea to forego a colonoscopy all together?

I've read stories about younger people getting bowel cancer and having it go undetected because it's seen as a disease older people get, so that's in the back of my mind.

Complicating or perhaps explaining all this, I was on two courses of antibiotics for unrelated infections during the last four months and three other courses in the past year....and I have had severe food allergies all my life to dairy, nuts and shellfish. When I was younger I had minor allergies to wheat and soy.

No real past medical history.

So the other night I was out drinking with my apartmentmates. We got drunk before we left and went out to a bar. I had one beer while I was there. This was, by no means, a very drunk night for me - I probably had 8 beers over the course of 4 or 5 hours.

At about 2:00, we hit the McDonalds down the block and were planning on going to another place afterwards (bars close at 3am here). I was feeling fine - we each got some McNuggets and as I was eating them, I started feeling a little lightheaded. A couple minutes later, my vision just tunnel vision-ed to black. I stood there for a few seconds, rather alarmed, before I was like ""guys fuck I can't see anything."" Next thing I know, I woke up slumped down against the wall and people were standing around me. I got up and found a seat and we sat down (after a thoughtful ""keep an eye on him"" from the security guard) and we got a cab home and I was fine for the rest of the night. I was really sweaty after it happened but that went away within like 20 mins. 

I have no idea how this happened. I ate breakfast lunch and dinner. I remember everything, except for the 1-2 minutes between when I couldn't see and when I woke up on the floor. The only thing that I could possibly think it could be is dehydration, because I didn't have much to drink all day. But I thought that the dehydration effect of alcohol took a little longer to sink in since I'd had a lot of fluids and my urine wasn't bright yellow or anything. Again, I wasn't that drunk.

No real past medical history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the other night I was out drinking with my apartmentmates. We got drunk before we left and went out to a bar. I had one beer while I was there. This was, by no means, a very drunk night for me - I probably had 8 beers over the course of 4 or 5 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At about 2:00, we hit the McDonalds down the block and were planning on going to another place afterwards (bars close at 3am here). I was feeling fine - we each got some McNuggets and as I was eating them, I started feeling a little lightheaded. A couple minutes later, my vision just tunnel vision-ed to black. I stood there for a few seconds, rather alarmed, before I was like &amp;quot;guys fuck I can&amp;#39;t see anything.&amp;quot; Next thing I know, I woke up slumped down against the wall and people were standing around me. I got up and found a seat and we sat down (after a thoughtful &amp;quot;keep an eye on him&amp;quot; from the security guard) and we got a cab home and I was fine for the rest of the night. I was really sweaty after it happened but that went away within like 20 mins. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea how this happened. I ate breakfast lunch and dinner. I remember everything, except for the 1-2 minutes between when I couldn&amp;#39;t see and when I woke up on the floor. The only thing that I could possibly think it could be is dehydration, because I didn&amp;#39;t have much to drink all day. But I thought that the dehydration effect of alcohol took a little longer to sink in since I&amp;#39;d had a lot of fluids and my urine wasn&amp;#39;t bright yellow or anything. Again, I wasn&amp;#39;t that drunk. I&amp;#39;ve been much more intoxicated, and nothing like this has ever happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Passed out for seemingly no reason. WebMD seems to think I might have MS, but that seems unlikely so I figured I&amp;#39;d ask.&lt;/p&gt;

Okay, so first of all, I've never felt my heart as much as I do now. It is extremely strange and sort of hard to describe.

One symptom is an occasional tightness in the region of my heart. It doesn't last very long, nor does it hurt very much, but it's enough for me to to notice and feel uncomfortable.

Second, sometimes I feel it beating abnormally hard. I was a swimmer in high school, but it has been a while since I have regularly worked out. At this point, it just feels like it is beating too hard for what I am doing. This is seldom, but seems to accompany the tightness.

Third, it feels like it is beating too fast as well. Again, this is not all the time, but enough for me to notice.

I've read up on dehydration possibly causing these symptoms and I am trying to drink more water recently but I'm still feeling these them.

The only medication I am on is birth control (Gildess FE 1/20). Any help to get my vagina back to normal would be VERY much appreciated.

In April I went to the Gyno for a yellow discharge and slight fishy odor. My main doctor was not available so I saw a PA. She took a culture and told me it looked like BV. She asked if I had a new partner recently and I said yes back in March I became sexually active with a new boyfriend. This is when my problems started occurring. She didn't think it was an STD but I asked to get tested regardless. The culture came back positive for BV and the STD test came back negative for everything.

She prescribed me some tablets to take over a 2 day period that I cannot remember the name of. There was no change from taking these so she prescribed metro gel to use every night for 5 nights. This helped a bit, but I got a yeast infection as is common after using this. So she prescribed 2 fluconazole tablets to take over 2 days to get rid of the yeast infection. The yeast infection went away but just a few days later the yellow discharge returned.

I went in the office again and saw my regular doctor. She took another culture (came back P for BV) and prescribed me metro gel for 10 days and went ahead and gave me the fluconazole tablets for the yeast infection that would occur after. A few days after finishing this the yellow discharge returned. (Those few days it was gone was absolute heaven)

I emailed the doctor and she prescribed 500mg Metro tablets to take every 12 hours for 7 days. I am on the last day of this and the discharge has been constant throughout. So I know I will have to go back in.

Is there any hope?!?



Other things I have done to try to get rid of this...
*I have changed all panties to 100% cotton
*I changed soap to Dove
*I have made sure I am washing properly (just washing the lips)
*I stopped taking as many baths (I shower typically 2X a day)
*Started drinking more water
*Started eating a cleaner diet and lost some weight
*Started taking vitamins (D, B, C, some days I will only take a multi)
*I started eating yogurt every morning
*I started taking a probiotic
*I tried taking Pro-B probiotic for vaginal health but saw no change and it's expensive so I didn't buy another bottle.
*I've started exercising more (I'm not as good about this one)
*I make sure my partner and I are clean before we have intercourse which has of course been rare since this started. (We don't use condoms as I am on BC he also pulls out as to not disrupt my ph)


I am very scared this isn't going to go away. **I feel absolutely disgusting!** Should I get tested for STD's again? They seem to only be prescribing the one drug. Is this the only one available for this problem? Are there any other steps I can take for vaginal health? I hope I'm not forgetting anything.

He is 50 years old, fit as an ox (bike commutes daily), eats healthy, has taken a multivitamin and a baby aspirin daily for decades, is on no other meds, and is in otherwise excellent health -- except for chronic, unexplained anemia. He has had the anemia for at least a decade.  About 5 years ago, his GP sent him for endoscopy to rule out internal bleeding. Then she put him on a course of B12 injections, that did nothing. However a few months later, his anemia then improved enough that there was no further follow up and he was okay. This year he went back for a routine check up and his anemia is back, and worse than ever. He had another endoscopy and a colonscopy. His GI tract is normal, no gluten intolerance, nothing. His B12 and folate is also normal, and his GP no longer thinks it's related to diet/B12 deficiency. She has referred him to a hematologist. She has run a ton of blood tests, everything is normal, except for his hemoglobin, which is below normal. She is also concerned with his low total blood count. His WBC and platelets are within normal range - but at the very end of low. 

Symptoms - he has all the symptoms of anemia you'd expect. Extreme fatigue, weakness, dizziness, fainting spells, sometimes short of breath, pallor, etc. He has a long history of unexplained, massive bruising (like, covering both his thighs, or his mid-torso). This comes and goes and he's never had a blood test or seen his GP during a bruising episode, but he has reported this to his doctor. On and off history of bleeding gums. And this week he admitted to me that his long bones ache. 

He showed me his blood tests so I did see the scores,  but he then took the paperwork away from me and filed them at work. I have asked for a copy and he won't give me one,  because he knows I am prone to worry too much. He tends to worry too, and I know he is much more worried than he is letting on to me.

His B12 and folate is also normal, and his GP no longer thinks it&amp;#39;s related to diet/B12 deficiency. She has referred him to a hematologist. She has run a ton of blood tests, everything is normal, except for his hemoglobin, which is below normal. She is also concerned with his low total blood count. His WBC and platelets are within normal range - but at the very end of low. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symptoms - he has all the symptoms of anemia you&amp;#39;d expect. Extreme fatigue, weakness, dizziness, fainting spells, sometimes short of breath, pallor, etc. He has a long history of unexplained, massive bruising (like, covering both his thighs, or his mid-torso). This comes and goes and he&amp;#39;s never had a blood test or seen his GP during a bruising episode, but he has reported this to his doctor. On and off history of bleeding gums. And this week he admitted to me that his long bones ache. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He showed me his blood tests so I did see the scores,  but he then took the paperwork away from me and filed them at work. I have asked for a copy and he won&amp;#39;t give me one,  because he knows I am prone to worry too much. He tends to worry too, and I know he is much more worried than he is letting on to me. &lt;/p&gt;

There's a tl;dr at the end, but you'd be missing a lot of background! :P  Also, I know the whole ""Reddit is not a substitute for professional medical advice"", I'm just trying to see if anyone has experienced anything similar / has any advice.  I'm not the kind of person who really ever goes to the doctor, and if a lifestyle change could help me I'd much rather do that first than spend thousands of dollars to have a doctor tell me the same thing.  However, this has been going on for over a year now and is impacting my life, and I want to do something about it if possible.

Quick about me: Male, 26, 6ft 145lb.

Current complaint:

Basically the biggest issue is that my stomach seems rather overly sensitive.  Every morning it feels uncomfortable / bloated, whether I force myself to eat something or not.  This often persists through the afternoon, and on occasion the entire day.  The discomfort is not so much pain as it is pressure, mild nausea, and bloating / the need to burp.  Sometimes antacids help a little, although that may just be placebo, and forcing myself to burp can help too. BM's range from 3 to 6 on the Bristol scale, varying on a near daily basis, and with the sense that things are not spending more than 12-24 hours in the GI system.  

This issue causes my second complaint, or is perhaps caused by, or perhaps they feed each other, which is kind of anxiety.  That is, when my stomach is upset, it makes me worry about it, which probably makes it more upset.  I'll start worrying that this time my stomach is going to be a little more upset than normal and I'll vomit, or that people will notice my discomfort, or... well, it's hard to describe because I know it's not really a logical feeling, but suffice to say my upset stomach can make me feel quite anxious especially when I'm around other people.

A third thing that may factor in to this situation is my sleep cycle.  I am currently trying to get a good amount of sleep, usually going to bed between 11 and 12, and waking up usually around 9am. Despite this, when I wake up I still feel incredibly tired (though not always sleepy, sometimes I wake up naturally but still feel groggy and tired).  I really can't get going sometimes until 10am, and I'm usually still a bit out of it (and worrying about my upset stomach) for the rest of the morning.


Background:

As for the stomach issue, I don't know where this is coming from. Growing up I was never particularly food sensitive (though I did tend to be a picky eater).  I believe I am mildly lactose intolerant, although I never ate very many milk products anyway -- don't like cheese or yogurt or drinking milk, that pretty much leaves ice cream, and these days I take lactaid with ice cream.  Last year I discovered that I'm apparently allergic to bananas; I had started eating bananas in 2012 and would have them as snacks, but at the same time my digestive health was going downhill, painful upset stomachs and occasionally bloody stool. Took me some time to make the connection, but I eventually realized that my stomach always became upset 15-20 minutes after eating a banana.  Stopped eating them and improved immediately.  However, I guess I'd say I never went quite back to normal, because since them I've been experiencing the symptoms described above.

I'd also classify myself as eating generally decently, I eat out some and cook for myself some, eat a mix of fruits, vegetables, meats, and pastathings, drink probably 80oz of water a day and a little fruit juice, not too into sweet foods / drinks, rarely ever drink alcohol or anything with caffeine. I'm underweight if anything.

For the anxiety, well, I'm not entirely surprised at myself. I've always been extraordinarily shy / had social anxiety issues.  Any time I'm entering a new situation or one where I'm not in control, I'm likely to feel some anxiety.  In my younger years I believe I suffered from depression; though it was never diagnosed or treated, I was really pessimistic about life and occasionally mildly suicidal. In the past 5-6 years, my mental state has dramatically improved with respect to the depression, and I've gained some confidence, but I'm still likely to be very anxious and/or awkward in social situations.  I suppose in my current situation, it's the fact that I can't control my stomach upset, and it might be noticed by others, and it might be potentially embarrassing, that causes my anxiety. Alternately, I'm experiencing stress / generalized anxiety which manifests as an overly sensitive stomach -- this is something I am not really certain about, is the anxiety an amplifying factor in a physical stomach condition, or is an upset stomach a psychosomatic response to a mental condition?

As for my sleep cycle, I've always been a ""night owl"" and have always functioned better at night. That said, in high school and before I had to get up early, and was able to do so without these issues. Throughout college, I also kept a generally earlier schedule.  It's only been the past couple years that I've just been unable to function well in the morning (oh, and if I force myself to get up earlier, my stomach will be even more upset throughout the day).  It doesn't matter if I go to bed at 9pm or at midnight, I still can't function in the morning (and I'll sometimes still take a nap for an hour or two in the late afternoon).  I'd almost describe myself as delayed-phase sleep disorder, because sometimes when I decide to stay up late working, I'll feel best and get the most done from like 11pm to 3-4am.  



So, Reddit, what do you think?  Do I have some physical issue causing my digestive upset, and if so is it some chronic lifelong thing, or something that could be treated / mitigated?  Or do I have some mental issue that's manifesting itself as sleep cycle problems and upset stomach?  Or do I have a sleep disorder that's causing stomach and mood disturbances? or do I have a bad case of intestinal gnomes?

tl;dr:  Suffering from chronic upset stomach (lack of appetite, nausea, bloating and discomfort); anxiety; and delayed sleep cycle / inability to function in the morning.  All three seem to be related, but I'm not sure what the core issue is nor what to do about it.  However, this has been going on for a while and is negatively impacting my quality of life, so I want to figure something out.",JustAnotherAltAcct,,,,0,,,False,t3_1xhtfa,True,False,,,1392007595.0,False,verified-doc,,0.0,t1_cfcojt3,Physician,1432351447.0,True,False,2,0,0,t5_2xtuc,t3_1xhtfa,False,"What you are describing here is basically a textbook case of mild irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and a mild social anxiety disorder combined. IBS is a functional bowel disorder strongly associated with anxiety and other psychosocial factors. Patients with IBS also have increased motility of their GI-tract (which you are describing) and often increased sensitivity to distention of their GI-tract. About 20% of the general population fulfill criteria for IBS, so it's very common. 

So the question is, what can be done to help you? Sometimes it can be helpful to eliminate/reduce certain things from your diet. About 20% will have some relief of symptoms by eliminating lactose (which you already did) and wheat from their diets. Also reducing caffeine (which can also increase anxiety, but you rarely use it it seems) and artificial sweeteners can help. 

As for the anxiety, there are many options. Being shy and feeling social anxiety in new situations is extremely common - so common that we may call it normal. You can always take some measures yourself to help your anxiety - like exposing yourself to new situations more often and going out to meet people more often. I know this can be very difficult, because it's unpleasant, but it will help in the long run. For example, when you have a choice between going out and staying home, try to always chose the option of going out. Just know that social anxiety is very normal, and everyone feels some anxiety in new situations where they dont have control. As long as you're able to live with it and go on with your daily activites it doesn't necessarily have to be a big problem. 

However if your anxiety comes to the point where you are isolating yourself or unable to go on with your normal life, I'd recommend seeing a psychologist. The best treatment right now is cognitive behavioral therapy, which is generally very effective. There are also drug treatments with SSRI's (anti-depressants) and specifically for anxiety and IBS, amitripyline. 

I think your sleep cycle-issues are also related to your anxiety, but might also be symptoms of depression.

When under mental (job interview, school exam) or physical stress (running, demanding workout) I start to retch and have to stop what I am doing and kneel down, shut my eyes and stay immobile to control my breath for 5-15 seconds while it passes away. I never wommit, but feel like I will any second.

It all started when I was in elementary school and realized that sit-ups make me nauseaus. I had no other sympthoms back than right until first year of university where the stress levels were much higher. There 10-30 minutes before exams I started the retching part.

At the age of 30 I gained a lot of weight, I was about 104kg and 185cm tall. I did martial arts, but the above described sympthoms appeart. It was so bad that just sitting in my car seemed to compress my stomach and lungs and I started retching.

At 32 I lost almost 20kgs and all sympthoms wanished. Now I'm back at about 95 and the sympthoms are worse than ever, especially because I had a knee injury last autumn and my conditioning is pretty bad right now.

The problem now is that I also seem to have decreased lung capacity. When I'm out of breath, the retching starts immedietly. I never smoked or drinked alcohol ever and still try my best during trainings, but my condition doesn't improve much.

During wrestling when my upper body is compressed, I immedietly start to panic beacause I'm out of breath. Never had this problem before.

Eating a lot and sugary drinks (especially energy drinks) make the sympthoms appear for sure, don't even have to stress or move a lot.

Even for confirmed streptococcal infection it's very debatable if antibiotics are beneficial if you compare side effects with benefits. URTI go away on their own, even if they are bacterial, with or without antibiotics, usually in 3-10 days. 

There isn't really a blood test to determine if you have a bacterial or viral infection unfortunately. Sometimes we use CRP, and there is some evidence to say that if the CRP is &gt;40, it's quite likely to be a bacterial infection, but it isn't a very good or specific test. 

However I haven't seen your daughter and I haven't examined her myself, so I can't really say anything more than that. If you are concerned, take her to another pediatrician or family doctor and get a second opinion.

It's worth noting that although I'm not overweight, I have an abnormal lifestyle. I'm extremely sedentary (I sit for probably at least 12 hours on a normal day and almost never exercise), and I have a pretty poor diet. I eat fruit and vegetables, but I also eat too much food with high fat-content (pizza) and sugar (like fruit juices and cookies).
Over the last couple weeks, I've noticed a few things that are concerning to me. I've had at least a couple instances of what I think are described as heart palpitations. I wasn't able to get any sleep last night after a palpitation. 
A few times recently, when I laid down to go to sleep at night, I heard my pulse/heartbeat in my ear. And on a few mornings, I woke up with slightly cramped calves. I've also woken up with my arm completely ""asleep"". And when I shovel snow outside, my hands go numb within 20 minutes, even though I wear fairly well-insulated winter gloves. This may not be related, but I've also noticed that my ears seem to ""pop"" a bit when I swallow. I don't remember that happening until recently. 

I'm worried that I might already have some sort of cardiovascular issue, whether it's atherosclerosis or something else of that nature. Maybe I'm just paranoid. Or it could be that I'm not paranoid, and someone else in my shoes would go to an ER immediately. I don't really know what to think, and I don't want to insist on getting a bunch of tests done if nothing is wrong. I don't always fully trust my own perception on these things, to be honest. Anyway, does it make sense to see a doctor about my concerns?

As long as it's not very fast (lets say about 100 bpm or more) or irregular I wouldn't worry too much about it.


2) Slightly cramped calves can be explained by many things. Maybe you did something the day before that your calves weren't so used too? Maybe you slept in an awkward position? Maybe they just felt that way because you focused on it, but perhaps they just were a little sore or nothing was wrong?


3) I don't know exactly what you mean by ""go numb"". Did you lose all sensation? Just some pricking? It can also be completely normal to lose a bit of sensation or feel some pricking of the skin if you're out in the cold and doing work, especially if you are a little out of shape.


4) It's probably not your ears popping, but your temporomandibular joint (TMJ) popping. This is also normal.


5) Well, we all have a little atherosclerosis. It starts from when we're young and progresses gradually. How fast it progresses and if we're ever going to have a cardiovascular event like a heart attack, stroke, aneurysm or something is up to genetics, lifestyle and some other factors. You're young, so even though your lifestyle isn't the healthiest, it's very unlikely that you have for example peripheral arterial disease that's causing numbness in your hands.


6) So does it make sense to see doctor because of this? Yes and no. There is no way I can give you a good answer to that just from the internet. I haven't examined you and done a proper history, I'm just writing my opinion and suggestions to what your symptoms might be related to. Personally I don't think any of your symptoms are very worrisome. However, if you feel like you need to see a doctor, go see a doctor.

The NNT for preventing one rheumatic fever in a developed country is 200.000 (because antibiotics are approximately 50% effective for preventing rheumatic fever).

So it started off on my arm, and i thought it was ringworm. I do highschool wrestling so it's not uncommon to obtain ringworm. I went to the doctors on friday, and he said it was empetigo which i still wasn't too worried about. He prescribed cephalexin 500mg 2 capsule's 2 times a day. And it made my empetigo on my arm start to go away a little/shrink. On thursday friday i noticed a few bumps on my forhead but i thought they were pimples. On saturday and into sunday it got a lot worse. Also on saturday i noticed my lymph nodes enlarged a little. On monday i went to the doctor and he took a culture sample (I think that's what it's called) and prescribed doxycycline hyclate 1 capsule 100mg twice a day in addition to the cephalexin. I had terrible headaches saturday-tuesday. They really lightened up today though which is great. The doctor said since i've been on the new antibiotic for less than 48 hours it's good that it hasn't spread and it's now not contagious. The culture sample should be in tomorrow to see if there's another antibiotic that will work better. Anyways, I normally wouldn't flip out about this but i have a state tournament on friday afternoon-saturday for wrestling and if i can't wrestle i'll be extremely crushed. It was great news that it's not contagious because i wouldn't want to give this to anyone else through spreading it on the wrestling mats/skin contact. But the other coaches might question it so i can always get a doctors note that says it's not contagious but even if i do, they might throw me out of the tournament because ""it looks bad"". So please reddit, i ask for some advice on what to do. How can i make it look not as bad? I heard it's bad to pop the blister like things filled with fluid, so i haven't been. I also heard it might help to apply warm to it to help it drain or something? Some of it's dried up like a scab. Is there any type of cream that would lighten it up?

Second, the neuropathy will only truly improve with long term control of your glycemic status and metabolic (B12, for example) stability. Unfortunately, everything else is palliative until then.
Third, there are nice therapeutic options you could try, **upon talking to your doctor** (of course), like duloxetine - but they should be tried long term to reach any improvement. Another option, but only as a last resort, could be the use of a sleep inducing medication (like a diazepine, for example) just so the consequences of the neuropathy are minimized.

ver the last few years I have felt like my general well-being is in decline. My co-workers call it stress, my friends call it old-age (I'm 24!!!) and my doctor just says it is nothing. However, the more I tally up my issues, the more I think/worry most of them may have a singular cause:

Tinnitus/v. sensitive hearing 

Blurred in one eye, nearsightedness (only recently discovered- never noticed before and not brought up in childhood eye tests)

Headaches/Migraines

Neck pain/severe muscle tension (Go to Chiro, Physio AND Remedial masseuse)

Forgetfulness (short term, things slip away quickly)

Twitches/muscle spasms 

Twitching eye 

Heart palpatations w adrenaline rush

Slightly enlarged optic nerve in right eye

Boughts of vertigo/dizziness/ ground feels like it is moving

Occasional insomnia (who doesn't get this, but i thought I would include it)

Fatigue

Lately, lack of enthusiasm for even fun activities


Bronchial cough

Short of breath

(Diagnosed with Stress-Related asthma. but as I lie here in bed, relaxing, I am short of breath, sooo....?)

I know some of these are general and vague problems that millions of people also deal with. I don't want a wild, obscure internet diagnosis, I just want to know whether, as Doctors, you would find these symptoms cause for concern. If so, I will push my GP to paying closer attention.

I went from 230 to 182lbs in 4 weeks. I saw my doctor twice during the 4 week span, it worried her at the time.

5 years ago I had these red painful bumps appear on my left neck, it is still there and painful once a month. 3 years ago a pilonidal cyst appeared.

I haven't actually seen any doctor since the stint 7 years ago. The reason is my fear of needles. 

My last visit she asked for a blood sample, I went fully knowing I would pass out like every other time. However this time just before i passed out i felt an extreme pain in my chest, honestly the only way i can describe it was when my lung collapsed after falling off a hill, when i awoke i had doctors standing all around me. My heart had stopped. They were freaking out, they put me on some kind of monitor and what not. They made a note to my doctor, but i never returned.

I had to have a filling done a year after that incident, i warned them i would pass out. That same painful feeling happened, and when i came to they were on the phone with 911 and freaking out. They said they couldn't feel a pulse, on staff nurse did cpr and called 911.

I need help, and i don't know where else to go. I don't fear death, but i certainly wouldn't want another person to think they caused my passing.

This constant pain in my stomach, the cyst, and my neck are all becoming too much. It's a rotation of pain cycles every month. The cyst is large enough i would be put under to have it removed. If i can't even take a needle for freezing, how in the hell would i survive any duration with an IV.

I pretty much just always feel like I have to go.

So I went to the doctor. Urine test came up negative for UTI, which was the obvious suspicion. Then was a blood test. Blood test came up normal. I don't have diabetes.

The weird thing is that i'm not really experiencing pain. There has been once or twice when there's been *mild* burning while I urinate. There's also been once or twice when I've felt a very dull ache in my lower back, the right side. But again, this was once or twice over the course of three weeks.

There's no blood, discharge, fever, or shivers.

So I went to see a Urologist. He confirmed its not prostate related.
It's also not that my bladder isn't emptying fully.

Next week i'm going to get my kidney checked but chances are, its not that. If it was, i should be experiencing quite a bit of pain.

Anyway, in my mind I feel like i'm running out of reasonable things it could be. The only thing i can find is Interstitial Cystitis. This seems weird because I'm male, 21 years old, and I'm not experiencing bladder pain.

I just feel like my symptoms don't really align with anything.

Oh also, one of the weirdest things about it is that I feel like I had it about a year ago, too. Except it only lasted for a couple days. I remember having to pee into a cup in my room because otherwise i'd have to wake up so much during the night. But again there was no pain.

My pain was a 7/10, but after pressing my back against a wall and using a tennis ball and Comcast remote, I was able to reduce the pain significantly to a 1/10. I can also feel a band of muscle in that area. The pain started 7months ago at it's worse but has been a 2/10 for 6months and even less now, but I still feel a kink.

I'm afraid of Lung Cancer or Pancreatic cancer. Also my nails are clubbed, but looking at old pictures they seem to have been that way since elementary, but in real time I know they've been this way since I was 17. Can anyone confirm it is infact clubbing?

Recently, I've seemed to fall apart a bit: tooth abscess in Nov (treated), c-diff from treatment in Dec (treated). I picked up a flu 2 weeks ago (muscle pain was bad, esp in limbs, but luckily no obvious lung involvement or super high fever). Also fortunately, the worst symptoms were over in 5 days. Biggest issue from that was how I took some of the remaining Vicodins for the flu pain (though still a half-pill per day), and constipation got to be an issue. I started eating prunes, drinking water, etc normal things to do.

I went to doc for several little things on Friday, mostly my regular (thyroid) labwork was due, refills on (thyroid) meds, but mostly, I had weird ""sore skin"" on boob/underarm, and thought it might warrant an x-ray or something. Doc (who is aging, and I fear might have a little dementia unfortunately) instead felt my abdomen. That's not unreasonable since I'd had c-diff, but instead of moving to underarm, he ""felt"" I was constipated (**painful** exam where he squeezed stool in colon), and he uncharacteristically *ended* the appointment with ""prescribed"" Miralax every night for forseeable future. (That's partly why I think he might have some dementia going on, because that's a dumb prescription. But doc may just be under pressure). So I just left with those ""orders"" (though I ignored the Miralax thing — I'm hoping to find new doctor soon before refills he forgot to refill run out.)

Over the weekend, my constipation cleared naturally (though painfully), and I seem ""regular"" now (YES!), but the exam area remains painful, where he ""squeezed"" the colon to point out constipation. He might have gotten things moving, but I think he bruised me in that area of lower stomach.

But the sore skin under the arm that he never look at? Turned to quite a lump this morning (Monday). The lumps hurt, and are visible. I'd guess one is the size of small plum under skin and protruding out side of breast and toward underarm. It does ""move"", though the skin around it is red, stretched, and painful when I try to do anything to it.

The ""matching"" lump on outside of left upper arm, about 5"" away, is completely new though, and nearly in perfect line from left breast/underarm lump, and it came out of nowhere. I don't try to move it at all because it's sore, but I can see (and definitely **feel**) it. That arm lump is the size of large grape maybe, and has the same red stretched skin over it.

I took some Benedryls and drank my water and a coffee (digestion reasons), and hoped someone could see me asap, but everyone was busy. (I have a gen. surgeon who handles endoscopies/colonoscopies for earlier ulcer issue, and OBGYN for ovarian cysts which are under control, but I was *desperate*.) I ended up just having regular doc's secretary append my file with note that I had ""lumps"" now, and taking it easy with a heating pad on arm/boob area.

But I AM about two seconds from taking another half-Vicodin to help pain. (Pain in stomach/gut from exam, as well as pain in boob and on arm. I think stomach pain is actually a little worse since I started writing, since I just ate a roll, but they're both in the 6/10 category, which is significant for me). Doc knew I was in pain on Friday (elevated hr and bp), but I'm trying to hold off on pain meds to not mess up digestion again. I'm *trying* to keep pain down with Gas-X and Tums for stomach pains, and use heat for arm/boob lumps, but this is both scary (anxiety-wise) and painful.

On the 24th my Dad was rushed to the Hospital and was found to be in Septic Shock from a dog bite a few days prior. He got out of the ICU on Friday, and was transferred to a rehab facility yesterday. 

I'm curious as to what his outlook is on his feet. Current Vascular Dr. says wait and see what falls off. 

Left foot seems to be in nice shape and I don't think we need to be concerned? The right foot does not look so nice. 

All of toes are completely hard on the bottom (pads). The top shows color receding daily and is still soft. The entire foot is extremely swollen overall. I guess this was supposed to be water weight, but he has been on lasix for about a week now and the left ft has gone back to almost normal size. Right is still supersized.

Since yesterday the bottom of the foot has developed some dark spots. He has been up on his feet quite a bit the last two days so I'm wondering if that could be general bruising from walking on a swollen foot.

Is there anything else he can do at this point instead of just waiting for skin to slough off and see whats left? Will he need some toes removed, entire foot, etc.?

Pics from today are at the top. Pics near the bottom are from the 4th

Sometimes I also suspect that the middle finger and pinky are hurting a little at their bases from time to time, but I'm bad at localizing my pains and not sure whether it's not just the middle finger...

Also, when I bend the middle finger to an angle of about 100° to my palm I feel a little ""snap"" also at the base of the middle finger.

you can treat them by drinking lots of water and eating enough fibers (the combination does the trick!) and go when you have to go (even though it might be painful sometime, holding it in will make your stool harder). 
If they keep bothering you and hurt, they can be treated by a gastrointestinal doc by shooting tiny elastic bands around them. The hemorroid will fall off after a few days. You still have to make sure your stools stay soft after that, because hemorroids can return.

I've had this for the past two days I guess and it is bothering my sleep. I am 22 year old Asian male with 170 cm tall and 70 kg. I was born in Malaysia and has been there for 20 years. 

Two years ago, I moved to Australia to study and am currently still here. I think I had this last year but not entirely sure about the time. I have tried using calamine lotion and taken a detox bath. I vacuum my room once a week. Recently, I washed my bed sheet and comforter sheet. 

It is very troublesome because I can't concentrate on my studies and it is affecting my sleeping schedule. I also went to Phuket about 6 weeks ago and swam in the ocean. 

I have also included the pictures of the affected areas which are my bottom legs. 

Please help me :(

Edit: I had vertigo lately and was prescribed prochlorperazine. Might I be allergic to that?

So I am working to get into the military. I went to the physical and got through everything fine. However, when they took my pulse and blood pressure I was extremely nervous as this medial will determine my potential career. My normal standing, resting heart rate is around 68-75, and sitting at about 65. The maximum for the army is 90. However when they took my pulse it was racing at 128. My blood pressure is usually ""normal"" i.e. close to 120/80 (usually a little higher). But during the test, I think it was around 156/68, essentially hammering. 

My question is this: I am required to do a retest, and I would like to know if there are any things i can do (outside of eating less sodium, alcohol etc) to drop my blood pressure and pulse? Im working on breathing easy and trying to relax but its not easy.

She is on 70mg a day. She also has liver cirrhosis and diabetes and the effects of the painkillers and these conditions has left her pretty out of it almost all the time.

She'd like to reduce her morphine intake but the pain is still quite severe and she's concerned about the stress (mentally) of going off the painkillers while in pain. One doctor did suggest amputation of the leg (from midway on the calf). She has actually came round to this way of thinking as the current effects of heavy painkillers is just leaving her unable to live her life normally. Unfortunately a further specialist ruled against this treatment, my mum says this was because of the cost of the operation but I'm not sure this wasn't any other possible complications. 

I'm going to speak to her doctors with her this week but I've tried before and they have seemed quite busy and it's hard to get any real solution.

Another option the doctor can try is treatment with hot peppers. This might sound silly, but what they do is try to pinpoint the pain to a small area, numb that area with lidocaine and then put a patch with a sort of hot pepper extract on them for a while. This gives the painful nerve such an overload of signals (that is why the lidocaine is used) that it shuts down for a while.

About a week ago, I started experiencing some abdominal discomfort which seemed to be slightly more serious than indigestion or gas. Not knowing the symptoms of appendicitis, but feeling increased discomfort in that area (as well as everywhere), I admitted myself to the local ER on Monday night. 

During my wait to see someone, I began to experience a great deal of anxiety, certainly more than I have ever experienced before. By the time I finally got in to be examined, I could barely speak properly and my stomach muscles were completely tensed. I'm sure the anxiety us a result of fearing something terrible is wrong for me and that something painful us about to happen (I've always been extremely squeamish about surgical matters). 

Blood/urine tests as well as a quick examination determined I was ""normal"". The doc gave my a prescription for Buscopan (which doesn't even need a prescription, apparently), which works pretty good for the tension in my stomach muscles — presumably caused by the anxiety — but the underlying condition is definitely there. 

I was luckily able to get an ultrasound the next morning which showed everything normal. They could only see part of my appendix, but were confident I did not have appendicitis because I have been showing none of the other symptoms. They suggested I see my family doctor to determine what to do next, but I don't have a family doctor, so...

A couple of days later I managed to get in to see a doctor at an ""urgent care clinic"". By this point, my anxiety had built to such a point that I felt like I was going to pass out several times while sitting in the waiting room. I'm not normally anxious at all, this ""panic attack"" level is certainly new to me. 

Anyway, the doctor looked at the blood/urine from the ER and saw a slightly elevated white count and a trace amount of blood in my urine. A physical examination revealed nothing new. She scratched her head and said I definitely didn't look or act like someone with appendicitis, and said there was a possibility of kidney stones, but from what I have been reading about *that*, I should be rolling around on the floor in agony right about now. 

So that's it. I'm on my own now trying to figure out what to do next. I guess my main question here is, *is it possible that a high level of anxiety could cause abdominal discomfort and cramping like this?*

I am literally at my wit's end here. That last doc gave me a handful of sleeping pills which she instructed me to cut into half doses to help with the anxiety, and that seems to be helping, but the second they wear off and I start focussing my mind on the sensations in my gut, the whole panic cycle starts all over again. 

If anyone here has heard of anything like this before or has even a clue what's happening, at least I would have something to shoot toward.

Yes, that is very much possible. You can have severe cramps, diarrea, and fear can even make you vomit. 

Actually, I have sort of been in your shoes 2 years ago. I have irritable bowel disorder, and though I know the cramps are harmless, pain obviously causes stress. I had a panic atack one day, and after that I had the same problem with tension in my abdomen that wouldn't go away. and if the tension went away, it felt so strange in my stomach that I was startled by that, and hello: welcome back tension. 

I had to go see a psychologist to break the cycle. 
My advice: use the sleeping pills only if you really need them. they do not break the cycle. 
The doctors already ruled out serious infections in your abdomen. So let that be comforting. 
you can also try meditation. I did a mindfulness course. the point of that is not that you think your discomfort away (that won't help) but just ""be"". And to give some kind, caring attention to yourself during the meditation. relaxing can be a nice side effect of that.

Basically, my stomach is like a little balloon 24/7. Where I used to at least wake up with a flat tummy, I haven’t seen it flat now for at least 2 years. It doesn’t necessarily feel bloated all the time, but I’ll have periods of time when it often does (even a salad will make me feel bloated), usually coinciding with mild constipation. I don’t really experience any notable stomach cramps or pains though.

Some facts:

- I’m a 22 year old female
- 1,5 years ago I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and since then the bloating &amp; constipation seem to have become worse (or maybe I just started paying more attention)
- My diet is overall quite healthy, I eat a lot of natural foods, but I’m also a sweet tooth and enjoy some cake/chocolate/ice cream here and there. My BMI is 21
- No idea if this is related: I stopped menstruating about 3 years ago for about 1,5 years, since then it’s been very sporadic, I get a light menstruation about every 3 months
- I am currently taking Movicol (which seems to help with the constipation, but not the bloatedness).

Could it only be because of stress? I'm a lot less stressed now than I was say half a year ago (I haven't felt quite right since a period of massive stress then, however), anxiety? But that's a longstanding condition. I'm wondering if it might be an iron deficiency, but three years ago my iron levels were fine and though I'm vegetarian (fish-eating), I can't imagine how much could have changed since then. My thyroid was also fine at that stage. Apparently magnesium deficiency is a cause of arrythmias, but apparently deficiency is fairly rare? I drink a lot of coffee but I don't think it's /that/ extreme - and it's because I often feel very tired and sleepy/have ADHD.

Ok, so since the end of February I've been having issues with my throat. For about 3 consecutive weeks, it was in absolute agony with nothing that would stop the pain except direct anti-inflammatory aids such as gargling soluble aspirin or mouthwash. Nothing else worked at all, or even soothed it a little bit.

First time I went to the doctors (March 4th) I was prescribed a week of antibiotics. 4 doses of 2 penicillin tablets a day. Did absolutely nothing, but doesn't look like tonsillitis anyway. I went back again a couple of weeks later, different doctor, said it didn't look like a throat infection but gave me a prescription for antibiotics anyway in case the symptoms developed (temperature and pus on the tonsils). 

Tonsils swollen a lot, but no pus. No temperature. Extreme agony for weeks. Gargling aspiring and mouthwash like my life depended on it. Started using the antibiotics out of desperation, though they did nothing.

Called the doctor on March 24th. I couldn't get an appointment but over the phone this third different doctor told me it could be glandular fever and advised me to book a blood test as soon as possible. I had the next day, on March 25th, and got my results today. My blood looks absolutely fine. No evidence of glandular fever.

My throat isn't in agony any more but my tonsils are still very swollen and laboured. I have a little fatigue and have had to have a nap most days. I've also been coming up in strange grey/yellow bruises lately for no reason, I don't think I've been knocked or anything in these places so I don't know if that's relevant.

My bosses are giving me a hard time over missing so much work because I'm just not fit to work and I haven't been for over a month now. I made it in a couple of days because I felt guilted into it and I'm scared for my job. I work in a busy coffee shop and it's pretty exhausting; clearing tables upstairs and downstairs, preparing food, running food to customers, etc. I couldn't work on till because talking would aggravate my throat. After tripping down the stairs and breaking a coffee-cup, the supervisor at the time let me just go on food prep which doesn't require much walking or talking. One time as I was reaching down to put some sandwiches in the over beneath the counter, I got a really bad pain in my chest and was winded for a couple of minutes. I've never had this before or any other chest problems.

I now have the bulk of my anxiety under control, however, I definitely still have some physical issues. Specifically:

- I feel great when I wake up in the morning, then I have coffee and something to eat and soon thereafter I start experiencing discomfort off and on. My condition seems to worsen as the day goes on. 
- 2 or 3 times a day, I will feel a sharp, stabbing pain that lasts literally a fraction of a second, somewhere around the area of my appendix. It's not lasting, it just feels like a sudden jab. 
- after eating, it seems like I can feel the progress of the food by the areas on my gut where I am feeling discomfort, starting with my stomach, then right kidney, then down toward the area of my appendix, then lower abdomen. 
- the whole right side of my abdomen is extremely sensitive to touch, once again, increasing in severity as the day goes on (ex: from intensity 0 to intensity 10 by the end of the day). 
- the main areas of sensitivity/soreness seems to be on my side, above my right hip and the lower right of my stomach/abdomen, closer to my groin. 

As I mentioned in my previous post, I have had blood/urine tests and an ultrasound and everything appears to be normal (regular bowel movements, temperature and blood pressure as well). 

- Does this sound like kidney stones? 
- Does this sound like gas or some kind of bowel obstruction?
- With appendicitis, would it flare up digesting food? Or is the appendix not at all connected with the digestion process (excuse my absolute ignorance)?

However the only I've been able to have regular (or somewhat regular) bowel movements is by drinking a small glass of milk every day or every other day. Laxatives take much longer to eventually work for me and I would rather not rely on them. Without the milk I seem to have one about every week (and they are far too small for the amount I eat). 

With the milk, I don't get diarrhea, but I do find they are much softer and easier to pass, and I don't have the small bit of blood that sometimes I would see otherwise. 

Furthermore, the upset stomach is far more mild and preferable than the stomach pains (sharp, and feeling like menstrual cramps but higher in the abdomen and not while on a period) I would usually get before, during, or after finally going, which is gone. 

Also it seems to stop the stomach bloat I used to get, keeping my stomach flat instead of looking pregnant for several hours (I'm not) with a round distended stomach that makes my pants nearly too small for part of the day and then too big other parts/times. 

Given this case, is it better to keep drinking milk to avoid these seemingly worse problems, or will continuing with the whole milk just cause other ones later?

I can get more details if necessary.

As of this morning, my grandfather has been hospitalized for the 3rd time within the past two years after experiencing intense hallucinations and paranoia. These hallucinations have included seeing men up in trees, men in the house laying wires and cables, men behind the fridge, men in the television watching/spying on him, being wiretapped, and most recently, believing that he is in a prison. These hallucinations have led to physical action from my grandfather (if you can imagine a 96-year-old man with a walker trying to pull the fridge away from the wall) and anger, as we don't see what he sees.

Up til his late 80s, my grandfather was very active. Played 18 holes of  golf a day, never lost his wits. Unfortunately, he had a slipped disk/pinched nerves requiring surgery that caused him to lose most of his mobility and he now requires a walker. While in the hospital, he suffered from C. diff. Now, he basically sits in his room all day and only walks to the bathroom or kitchen.

Previously, the doctors claimed the hallucinations were from dehydration. They gave him anti-psychotic drugs and put him in a rehab center until he was cleared to return home, no longer hallucinating. Again, this has happened several times over. While my mother is his primary care-giver and I have little information on what really has been happening, I cannot fathom how random and recurring bouts of hallucinations have not warranted deeper consideration for a diagnosis past dehydration.

He is on a few medications (not sure which ones). Yes he's an old guy but he's not on his deathbed. Needless to say this has caused undue stress on our family and we are at a loss.

Usually it occurs when they are ill, and it is called delirium. It is treated by treating the underlying illness and with anti-psychotics (usually a low dose of haloperidol). And yes, dehydration can be a cause, but that is obviously pretty common in sick people. 
Unfortunatly, people who once have had delirium, are very vulnerable. They take very long to recover, and sometimes wont recover fully, as it can cause damage to the brain. 
However, as long as he is still hallucinating, he is not treated optimally. I will not give you advice on the medication as I am not his doctor, but you should talk to the person who is. And you can help your father with a very regular schedule. Have meals on set times, give him a calendar with large letters and hang something in his bedroom that says where he is (you are in your home/hospital/whatever) and a clock he can easily read. When is is hallucinating, don't discuss it endlessly. Don't fantasize along with him, just stay calm and tell him that what he is seeing is not real. If he doesn't believe you, let it go. Help him with activities that he likes and suits him when he has a clear moment.

I looked it up and found out about plantar fibroma, a slow growing non-cancerous tumor that is more of a bother than harm.

However, it is now clearly visible, triple the size, and even more painful and bothersome than before. This causes me concern because what I thought it initially was is supposed to be slow growing. Not tripling in size in a few weeks.

Any ideas on what it could be?

I would go to the doctor, however, my insurance is in another state which I only visit a few times a year. So it is either wait it out or pay to see someone here. And I don't want to pay if it is nothing to worry about.

When I flatten my finger and move it, there is no pain however when I bend my finger, particularly when I bend it and move the entire finger upwards (like when you click using a mouse), that is when it aches/hurts. There is no visual sign that anything seems to be wrong, only pain/discomfort when I bend the finger.

I'm not sure where to post this, so I am trying here first. If there is another, better subreddit for this question, I would be thrilled to post there instead! Please let me know. 

I have a son who is nine years old (48 inches tall, 48 pounds, in the 3rd percentile for height/weight for his age) who is immunocompromised. We've been seeing a team of doctors at a well-regarded Children's Hospital for several years  now, but the only diagnoses they've been comfortable giving him thus far are Autism and Generalized Immune Deficiency Syndrome. He's had all vaccines save for live vaccines. 

I have a toddler (17 months, healthy) who is due for his MMR vaccine. Since it's a live vaccine, my older son's doctors have been iffy about my younger son getting the vaccine. My younger son has had all vaccine which are not live vaccines to date, but no live vaccines. 

Currently, I am trying to figure out just *how* risky it would be to give my younger son the MMR vaccine. I want to give it to him, I know how important it is. My older son's team of doctors have left it up to me. They have explained there is *some* risk of my older son contracting measles from my younger son after he is vaccinated/shedding the virus. They have been unable/unwilling to give me hard data to help me make the decision. They've told me it's 'my call'. While I appreciate the respect given to personal discretion, I do not feel as if I have the information I need to make this decision. 

What I am wondering is how frequently does an immunocompromised person exposed to someone shedding a virus from a vaccine actually contract the disease? Are there any studies, or statistic, or hard data, regarding this situation? 

While I'm at it, how risky would it be to give my older son the MMR vaccine himself? How often do live vaccines given directly to a person who is immunocompromised cause 'problems', and what 'problems' do they cause? I've asked my older son's doctors this question as well, and only gotten incredibly vague answers, and been told that in the end it's 'my call' as to whether or not to give him live vaccines. Due to my son's medical issues, he's not attended regular public school, and has instead been enrolled (by our local district) in a public at home learning program... so his exposure to things has been very limited. But as he ages, I wonder if we should reconsider the live vaccines for him as well, and wonder what data is available regarding vaccinating folks who are immunocompromised. 

Pointing me to information on this subject that is easily understood by someone who is not in the medical field, or explaining what you understand to me would be greatly appreciated. Any help at all is welcome! 

Thank you! 

Edit : I know separating the children for a period of time post-vaccination would eliminate the risk entirely, but unfortunately this is not an option, and it will not become an option. We've spent the last several months trying to figure out any way we could make this arrangement work, but there really isn't a method that would work for our family. I wish there was! It seems like the easiest solution.

The last couple of weeks I've had mild vaginal itchiness, almost like when you've shaved and the hair is growing back (which is a possible explanation of said itchiness). It definitely was mild itching and only happened like once or two a day for like 15 mins at a time, it seems to be gone now. So, the other day I went to itch with I was using the restroom. I have fake nails and knew it wasn't a good idea to itch with those, so I used a bit of balled up toilet paper. When I pulled the paper away, it was absolutely drenched in blood. Apparently I ripped or cut or tore something. It wouldn't stop bleeding, but I was at work so there wasn't much I could do. I got home and tried to inspect it and just saw a pretty large (1""-1 1/2"") sized gash. This was really odd because there was no pain whatsoever. What could this be?

A couple more things:

- I'm on depo and haven't had a period in years. There's a 0% chance that that's what it was. It was bright red, new blood. Definitely not period blood.

* I had unprotected sex about two to three weeks ago and took plan B the next day. 

* I have had chlamydia in the past, but I've had 2-3 tests since show up negitive.

I have had periods of lethargy before but not as bad or as long lasting as this. I thought it could have been the fact I changed from the contraceptive implant to the pill at first but that was 3 weeks ago now.

I had one blood test last Friday which apparently showed low haemoglobin levels but results from a retest on Wednesday have just come in as normal. Not seeing the doctor until Monday but my symptoms aren't really any better.

My aunt is having a baby today!

This isn't the first time a family member has been pregnant, and I've grown up around babies and small children, so I know the ground rules for handling them. In fact, I've held all but 2 of my (soon to be) 7 cousins within 48 hours of their birth. But this is the first time I was sick near the day of birth.

I started feeling nauseous around Sunday afternoon and got a tickle in my throat. Monday morning the tickle turned into a sore throat, couldn't eat without feeling queasy, had some gross nasal drip (which was contributing to the queasiness and sore throat), and felt weak. That went on into Tuesday morning, but by Tuesday night I had my energy back and by Wednesday morning I felt perfectly normal. So, I had a cold, and not a particularly bad one at that. I feel completely fine now, though I did get up a bit of phlegm either this morning or yesterday morning, right after I woke up. That might have been residual phlegm from the cold, or it might have been from asthma or allergies- it's pretty normal for me. I am not coughing or sneezing.

I THINK I'm safe, but I wanted to check to make sure that I'm definitely clear to go see my aunt's baby today, because I don't want to get her sick.

I'm pretty sure my age (19) is the only relevant part, but just in case I am biologically female, 5'4 and 145-150 lbs (not sure exactly), white w/ hispanic heritage. I have asthma and I take albuterol as directed as well as vyvanse for ADHD.

I hope I have the right subreddit for this. I'm looking for an opinion on something I've written from someone with medical training. I'm writing a short piece for my blog about how our relationship with death has changed in the past 600 years. Specifically I'm comparing the contemporary Transhumanist movement and the rise in the 14th century of the Dance of Death phenomenon. 

Anyway I'm trying to give an objective, short description of the Black Death. But I'm not sure if I've accurately described the way in which people actually died. I'm looking for someone to give this a read over and let me know if I'm making any big mistakes. What I have so far:

""
During the 14th century a pandemic spread through Europe. Later identified as the bacterium Yersinia Pestis, and contracted primarily through flea bites, this plague killed about half the population of Europe. After initial contact with the bacterium, primarily through infected flea bites, an incubation period of several days occurs. This is followed by a fever, headaches and chills. Then after accumulating in the Lymph and Inguinal nodes a series of Buboes, similar to huge blisters, would appear around the groin, arpit and neck. As the infection spread, the bodies ability to control blood clotting broke down. Internal bleeding under the skin gives the appearance of huge bruises, and necrosis sets in as tissues fail to receive proper levels of oxygen and nutrients. Eventually this tissue would begin to turn black, giving the pandemic its name: The Black Death. As Circulatory Shock sets in, the body shuts down and the victim eventually expires.

People who came into contact with those already infected could themselves become infected through contact with aerosolized bacteria released into the air by coughing and sneezing. This hard to avoid contact infected the persons lungs and led to an extremely lethal version of the disease. Sufferers would experience a progression from fever to chills, coughing, chest pain, shortness of breath, coughing up blood (infecting more people), fatigue, low blood pressure and finally the aforementioned Circulatory Shock as the bacteria spread throughout the body. This extremely virulent form of the infection killed somewhere between 90-100% of the people who contracted it.
""

Not very pleasant. Part of what I don't think I understand very well is what specifically caused victims to die. Wikipedia mentions Disseminated intravascular coagulation. Does this mean the blood supply is shut down? Would you suffer strokes because of this? Does the bacteria itself cause the clotting or is the clotting a response by the body to the bacteria?

I am currently diagnosed with ADD/ADHD and have been taking medication for 4 years. 

I diagnosed myself with Parkinson's because:
-I have had a mild tremor for the past 4 years
-Only one of my arms really swings, the other barely does. 

I diagnosed myself with schizophrenia because: 
-My aunt on my mother's side had a severe case.
-Amphetamines(ADHD medication I think?) and marijuana have been shown to onset schizophrenia. 
-ADHD it's self puts you at increased risk for schizophrenia. 
-I have felt extremely dumb for the past 6 months, just slurred thinking, loss of my train of thought, forgetting vocabulary, bad memory. At the point before this began I thought of myself as very intelligent, well spoken, great vocabulary, great memory.
-And finally, the trigger to this diagnosis: today, walking out of the library at school I heard someone yelling my name, yelling ""where are you going?! What are you doing?!my name, my name, hey!"" I swear I thought it was real, I thought the librarians were yelling at me or didn't know I took the pass or something, I even walked back 50 feet down the hallway (thinking about it they would have to have been yelling very loudly, but) and went back into the library like and idiot to find nothing out of place the librarians just doing what they do. That really scared me, and I've literally felt sick(nauseous) thinking about my future if I were to have this disease.

Finally, I diagnosed myself with hypochondriasis because of all these diagnoses. When I think about it, wouldn't diagnosing myself with hypochondriasis mean that I do in-fact have hypochondriasis?

I am currently being treated from an arteriovenous malformation by doctors in Spain. Actually, some time ago I made a [post on reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/lysx8/my_venous_malformation_is_so_unique_that_i_want/) with an old account.
My question is: Due to that AVM I describe in the post, I got damaged skin in the place where an ulceration appeared (to disappear some time after). My vascular doctor said that it is an unavoidable consequence. 


Does it make sense to ask for an appointment with a dermatologist to treat and try to repair that skin without having completely fixed the underlying problem (AVM)? Or is it a better idea to focus on getting appointments with the vascular doctor first?

I recently moved to another city and I am not in contact with my former doctor anymore. I will start treatment in a different hospital with different insurance, so I haven't seen my new vascular doctor yet. I just wonder what makes more sense, since every visit comes with a certain waiting time, and certain economic costs, so I would like to get it right from the beginning and don't go to the wrong doctor...


I know that the AVM is much more complex and it's taking much longer time to treat, but if it makes sense to repair the skin in the meantime, it would be great.  If it doesn't make sense because as long as the AVM is hitting in full force the skin will get damaged again, then maybe I focus on vascular visits first. 


Thank you for your time! I just hope that my question was trivial enough despite the problem itself not being that trivial. If you can advice me in which order should I visit doctors, I would be grateful.

I've had this problem for ages, but am just now asking for an opinion. It doesn't seem to exist in any corner of the internet I've searched.

Sometimes, whether sitting or standing, I get a jolt of pain in the area between the testes and anus. I think it's called the ""gooch"" but that isn't a proper term, and I want to be taken seriously as this is a problem I'd like resolved.

I don't do anything to the area. I don't tamper, touch or otherwise mess with anything down there. It just happens. I'll be sitting quietly, and it happens. Today while shopping for food, it happened while walking. The only thing I can do is wait until is passes. Clenching usually helps. I quote the word minor because it isn't excrutiating, but it is annoying. Very annoying. And still painful to a degree.

This sounds strange, I won't deny that. But it is a serious inquiry. I wouldn't waste the community's time with piss-taking threads. I'd be happy to answer any questions asked. Thanks in advance.

Yesterday I had a lot of food to eat. Like, I ate a whole pizza and ate giant ass thing of popcorn from the movies, all within the span of a few hours. Later that night I had one shot (my first for the night) and I coughed it up immediately. I ran to the bathroom and puked everything I had in my stomach. Except, after the last dry heave there was a little tiny bit of bright red blood. I feel like this was because I didn't take the shot correctly, and I might have accidentally inhaled it, irritating my stomach and my lungs, thus coughing up the blood after puking.

It could be that my esophagus was just a bit irritated from all the food I had eaten and I kept drinking (bad idea) and got really, really drunk. This led to more puking, however no more blood came out at all and it didn't look like it was anything to be worried about, despite being a bit mucous-y. I ended up being very cold and showed signs of alcohol poisoning. My friends stayed with me until they were confident that I was okay, and then left. 

I wake up today with a bad hangover. I've been drinking a lot of water all day and occasional soda water to calm my upset stomach. I feel, well, hungover. Exhausted, sleepy, unable to concentrate, typical hangover muck. I'm worried about the bit of blood I coughed up last night, it was a very small amount and it only happened once. My eyes aren't jaundiced, my skin looks normal, I'm not shitting/pissing coffee grounds or blood, my breathing is normal, as is my heart rate.

Occam's razor leaves me to believe I screwed up taking the shot and irritated my already pissed off stomach and lungs, and now I'm just suffering a bad hangover. But according to google, these symptoms could mean that I'm suffering from anywhere to a bad hangover, acute liver failure, or something else.

I'd like to avoid going to the hospital if possible, but I'll go if you guys really think it's something I should do. Thanks.

I've always had issues with ears popping but it's gotten unbearable last few weeks, just thought they were clogged at first.

Anyways he said it was either TMJ/Congestion/Adenoid and turned out it could be all 3.  Said i had mild adenoid hypertrophy and the gland was pretty big.  Was given script for nasal steroids, told to try 30mg of sudafed every 12 hours, and maybe advil.  My tonsils have always been enlarged since I was a kid and said it probably happened same time as that, I've always been mouth breather etc. 

Just have a few questions, from the sound of it, he seemed to think while nasal steroids could shrink it, I'd be begging for surgery by the time they help.  Any chance they do anything?  Also my mom acted like he prescribed me cyanide when I said steroids, are they safe?

While I've always had an issue on like planes for the most part it's been ok and I just cleared my ears, so not sure why in the last few months it's just gotten this bad out of nowhere when I've had this most of my life.  The only thing I can think of is I've changed my diet quite a bit in last two months.  Should I cut all dairy/whey protein and see if it improves?  I'm a baby and don't want the surgery.

Lastly one of my salivary glands was harder, he said not to worry but gave me script for ultra sound.  I was googling adenoid surgery and third thing that came up was salivary gland cancer, so now I'm super paranoid?  Should I not be worried?  Could this because of new diet also?

Background info (**You might want to read of my problems first to know what you need to know!**):

 I am 16, turning 17 in a couple of months, I am a boy and I live in Finland. I am 185 cm tall, I weigh 64 kg, I don't use meds. I have minimal amounts of stress as far as I know, I ride a bike approximately 2-4 km a day, I walk around 4 km a day, I sit many hours during a day, most of it on a saddle chair.

I eat quite a lot but I am still underweight. I typically eat oatmeal for breakfast, have some oat cereals for a snack, eat a lunch and a dinner with gluten-free pasta, rice, potato or such and typically meat or fish with it, in some form. I usually have yoghurt for evening snack.

I hardly ever hurt myself in any way physically. I haven't been to hospital to fix an emergency.

That's about all possibly relevant information I can think of now, ask if you need to know more.

1. **I have [IBS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome)** and I can't figure out what I can and what I can't eat. I seems to sometimes hurt very randomly and for different reasons. I've been thinking about a very strict diet, eating only one ingredient all day, testing stuff out that way, but I don't know how I would go around doing that! Any help appreciated here. Currently my stomach has been hurting pretty much everyday, unless it's kind of jammed and hurts more the next day.

2. **[I have reflux disease](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease)**. I have heartburn every now and then. It's not very severe but it is very likely that I have [inflammation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagitis) there. I often feel some constriction at my chest area on top of heartburn. I tend to suspect [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pectus_excavatum), which is relativly severe, but as doctors said, shouldn't cause trouble at all. Sometimes with it I start feeling powerless and I don't feel like doing anything. No solution has been found after going through MRI, which showed nothing was wrong.

3. Out from this digestive system problem overall, I've noticed that all the skin on my leg at my private areas seems quite rough and red. All the areas where my thing can possibly reach, basically. It's been like it for a while, and probably caused by having legs crossed often. Also, my foreskin seems a little torn from the right, a couple of very minor wounds that don't bleed but look like they could at any given moment. Maybe because my right leg is often on my left leg?

I would be going in and out to the bathroom gagging over the toilet but no matter what, I couldn't get sick, my mouth would just water up and I would burp up air a bit and clear flem. Along with this I had a massively reduced appetite however around mid-day the nausea would always go away and I would feel fine, I would then start to feel hungry around 7 in the evenings, but even eating a hand full portion of anything would leave me feeling like I had eaten two full meals, I would feel very bloated and full to the point of sickness.
I tried changing my diet and even eating habits (Eating before sleeping) and none of this seemed to effect the morning nausea and gagging. I did notice that while I stopped eating before bed, I would wake up with a stale feeling in my mouth and from my breath.

This has been going on since then, however sometimes it would be severe nausea and other times I would wake without the nausea at all, the only thing that stayed through out was the lack of appetite and the fullness on tiny portions. 
However recently in the past two weeks the nausea has been constant throughout the day and my appetite is absolutely zero and I haven't eaten in three days as even the smell or thought of food makes me gag. I do intend on seeing my physician as soon as I possibly can but I would love any feedback or suggestions anyone may have until that time.

I've recently turned 19 years of age.
I am a an Irish Caucasian male.
I'm about 5'7 or 5'8 in height.
Just before the sickness I weighed in at 11.5 Stone/ 161 Pounds but now I am closer to 10 Stone/ 140 Pounds. (A lot of this weight loss seems to have happened quickly over the past week or two as many people have commented on the weight loss)( It's also certainly to do with the sickness, as there has been no additional exercise or dietary changes).
Sickness noticeable since December 1st - Present.
Stomach sickness. 
I have been told it sounds like an ulcer which there has been cases of in my family.

When I was about 16 I broke out in an all over body rash which doctors could not explain. I had blood tests etc. taken and everything came back clear. It lasted a good 2 months. The only answer doctors could give was that a build up of stress may have caused it as it was a very stressful period. The rash eventually went away, after a weeks use of an external cortisone cream. However it had looked to be clearing up already.

If you would like any more info which may help you solve the cause of this I'd be more than happy to help. Thank you for taking the time to read this post and any input you may have would be gratefully appreciated.

I cannot tell you if it really is an ulcer, but you can try some things at home while you wait for the doctors appointment. First of all, put the head-end of your bed a little higher. This way, gravity helps everything stay in your stomach. No coffee, no energy drinks, and no soda's. Stay away from spicy food and make sure that the things you do eat are full of energy (so no cucumbers and other food that is low in calories, you need those now!)
You can try an over the counter antacid to help sooth your stomach in the mornings.

OK, it's embarassing but I'm almost 100% certain i know what's the problem.

Sometimes I ejaculate in the bath, usually with my penis facing the shower(I'm that stupid), the thing is: semem + hot water is a terrible combination as the water washes almost everything liquid away, leaving only a solid, jelly like, sticky protein-thing behind.

And that's the thing that's inside my urethra as I type.

The good news for me is that the three or four times it happened before my body ended up curing itself after 1-2 days max. I guess the solid stuff slowly desintegrates/is absorbed by the body.

The bad news is while i wait for it to disapear, peeing *hurts*, I don't even want to imagine what ejaculate with that crap would feel like. So i usually avoid drinking or eating anything that would make me need to go to the bathroom sooner(basically everything). And it's a torture.

I'd like to know if there is anything that i can do to speed up through my suffering, I know that there are some liquids that break/desintegrates protein. But shoving it up my urethra doesn't seem like a good idea.

I also assume that taking vitamin C helps with the liquification of semem, so maybe if I take some pills and try to(urgh) ejaculate again the problem would be solved. But i'm really afraid to try.

I swear my sperm is never getting anywhere near hot water again.

I'm not a native speaker so I'm sorry for any mistakes. Someone please help me out.



EDIT: *It seems i was right, I kind of fixed it and I think i'll be good.*. **If anyone is facing something similar, here's what I did:**

-Take a shower. Soap and even shampoo will help you clean what is inside your donger. **FOR GODS SAKE DON'T SHOVE ANYTHING(LIQUID OR NOT) IN THERE**. Get a small plate(what are they called in english?) or maybe a shallow cup, fill it with soap(you'll need a bit of *cold* water too, but not too much), and make your donger's tip ""kiss"" the solution(after you laugh of my weirdly accurate analogy). I actually tried both soap and shampoo(it has similar cleanup effects), both worked but there are so many tipes of shampoos that maybe you won't have that much luck.

The important stuff to remember is: don't let anything actually enter your dingle in a way that it won't come out, always try to point the head to the ground or to the front, NEVER to the roof. And I wouldn't try to force open the urethra, but that should be kind of obvious.

If the pain continues, or if it's been there for more than 2-3 days. **GO SEE A DOCTOR ASAP IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING REALLY BAD**

So, I'm going to try to keep this as short as possible. 


I went to see my doctor about two months ago, apparently they're booked through June so I saw the Nurse Practitioner. I was having a sore throat for about 7-8ish months at this point (Id seen my doctor around 3 times about it) that wouldn't go away, my neck was hurting to the point where it hurt to turn it, and I was super tired all of the time. I'd seen my doctor before and he basically just prescribed me some cough syrup and sent me on my way. She said my thyroid was very enlarged, and wanted to do bloodwork and have a thyroid ultrasound done. CBC, T3, T4, and a mono test. It all came back okay other than a small goiter on my thyroid. So she sent me to an ENT.


When I saw the ENT he basically felt my neck for a minute or two, looked down my throat, saw I gained around 30lbs recently and said it was GERD. He put me on 40mg of Omeprazole. 


Ive been taking the Omeprazole for about a month and half now, cut out junk food, and haven't had hardly any caffeine in the last month and I still feel just as crappy as ever. Now there's a little red spot right beneath my jawline that keeps popping up that looks pretty swollen and red. Ive also had two migraines that have lasted over 8 hours in the last two months and I've had probably one migraine before in my life. I'm pretty frustrated with the whole thing and feel like every doctor I've seen has just dismissed it so any advice you could give me would be appreciated. Thanks!

I have been working on converting a short story into a novel for quite some time now. In the short story, the main character dies of an unknown illness in a brief span of time, but as a novel I feel it deserves more attention. The character seems perfectly healthy (though editing in small symptoms beforehand would be an easy task) until suddenly taking ill while on a vacation. She is rushed to the hospital with a high fever, and in the original draft died within a month, with the doctors eventually just doing what they could to make her comfortable. 

I would like to expand her illness out to a year, where she takes ill, recovers slightly, lives out a year in a weakened state, then her condition dips drastically until she dies in the hospital about a month after the dip.

With the shape of the novel, I have tremendous flexibility to adjust her story and condition as necessary, so any suggestions would be welcome. 

As far as her details, she's about 20 at the time of death, average height, about 120 pounds, white, and lives in eastern America.

Thursday I noticed that on my tongue, there were thread-like tiny filaments in the middle/front of my tongue, red bumps at the back and tiny white dots all around. I went to see the doctor today and he didn't make a big deal out of it and made me do a bacteria-culture thing. Results take at least a week. Also made me do blood test and urine. 

Now, I'm getting anxious about it. He told me he doesn't think it's fungus (coz fungus usually tends to grow in ""islands""). I want to know what do you think may be causing the problem? I'm not HIV positive. Can it be oral cancer?

Let me start with some background. Yes, I already been to the doctor and they already told me they could not find anything

I'm on the computer for many, many hours every day of the week. I occasionally get blurry vision (almost like double vision) in my right eye while my left eye is never affected. When this happens, I cannot see at all unless if I close my right eye. I tried using all different types of eye drops and nothing fixes it - only resting it does.

These days I cannot even look at a screen the size of my smart phone before my eyes get blurry (both of them). I'm really stuck right now and I have no idea what I can do about this problem. I don't know what type of problem this is or how I can get rid of it for good. I dont even know where to start looking.

I already have been to 2 different doctors who both referred me to a separate optometrist. Both optometrists came to the same conclusion and I strongly believe there's some underlying problem going on.

Thanks for all the help.

I went with my group through our days worth of a trip, during which my cheek continued to swell. It doesn't hurt it just has kept slowly growing till it got to the pictures at the end.

   I am 17, male, 135 lbs, 5'11.5"", Caucasian who has been experiencing swelling for the last 14 hours. I am currently in Florida and I am not on meds except for the 2 ibuprofen I took last night.

   For background, I have had a toothache for the past 6 weeks (not constant. it flares when I eat using certain teeth.) and I took ibuprofen yesterday to combat a bad sunburn on my nose (anti-inflammatory properties??). This afternoon I remembered that my mother has allergic reactions to ibuprofen, but someone else also said that it looks like the swelling from someone who had their molars removed. My question is what do doctors think (I will be cross posting to /r/Dentistry. I have a performance on Tuesday and I would love my sexy face back. Finally, i will be up till 1am est to answer questions. Then at 6 I will come back and continue.

For the past week I have had problems with a tightening pain in my chest and struggling to breathe.

I have struggled with panic attacks for years and so does my mum, therefore I'm used to them, know exactly how they normally feel and how to deal with them - my mum insists that this past week has just been really bad panic attacks due to stress with uni work.  She also thinks my hormones may be causing panic attacks as I have been on my period for at least 2 months (I also have the implant (for 11 months)).  I'm not sure whether the implant or my hormones could be causing this.

The symptoms I have are very sudden shortness of breath - as though the air is thick and I'm struggling to breathe it in (this happens out of nowhere in a matter of seconds and lasts for around 40 minutes)  shortly after this starts I experience a tightening around my chest as though an extremely heavy weight is on it.  I can also feel all my muscles tightening as I'm struggling to breathe.  I also have pins and needles and numbness in my face and my heart races extremely fast for around half an hour.

This is happening around once an hour all day long meaning I am not getting any relief.

Previous panic attacks I've had in the past have felt different to this and although I have felt shortness of breath while panicking I have never felt like I physically cannot breathe.

To deal with the problem this week I have been trying to stay calm, concentrate on my breathing as I normally do with panic attacks but this has not been working at all.  My doctors here aren't very helpful and are always busy as I'm in a city - I am heading home to see my old doctor in a couple of weeks but cannot wait that long for answers. 

I have suffered from asthma as a child but not for years. 

I really just need to know if you think this could just be panic attacks or if this could be anything else and I shouldn't just assume it is only a panic attack.

What happens is that you start to take short shallow breaths, causing the co2 in your blood to get really low. low co2 gives you the feeling that you cannot get any air, panic and the pins and needles in your face (usually especially around the mouth). If you do it for too long, you faint and then your body takes over breathing normally again. 
You can help yourself by doing breathing excersizes (4 seconds in, 8 seconds out) or if you are really panicking: breathe in a plastic bag. This way you reinhale the co2 you exhale. 

However, if you have wheezing breath while exhaling during the attack, it can indeed be an asthma attack. do you still have your inhalers (salbutamol)?

I've done a lot of freaking out, long bouts of hypochondria and stress etc. I've read a lot online about low and high-risk HPV types, and what I really want to know is how likely a person is to have HPV turn into cancer.

Looking for answers to the strange pains I have been having for over 4 months now.  It started out in my right ankle, with no injury.  It then showed up in my right thumb, left elbow, and how the base of my skull or top of my neck.  They are super sharp pains that are constantly there.  I have tried heat, ice, rest, and relaxation to help with the pain, but nothing has worked.  I have also tried tylenol, flexeril, and gabapentin.  

I have been diagnosed with Crohn's Disease for 7 years and tests showed it was in remission.  I have been tested for Lupus, Rheumatoid Arthritis and normal Arthritis... blood tests were all negative.  I have been on Remicade for the last four years to treat my Crohn's, and the blood tests for that show no negative drug reactions.

I visited my primary doctor, who did relatively nothing to look into the pain I have been having.  He referred me to a specialty Rheumatology clinic, but they can't see me for another month.

At this point I have no idea what to do.  The pain is making it impossible for me to go to work, walk my dog, and even do small every day tasks. Has anyone ever experienced any thing like this?

I began experiencing somewhat overwhelming dizziness over the last month - it began as a coming-and-going sensation but has gotten worse over the time frame. I have this vague numbness also - my forehead feels somewhat numb almost all the time, especially on the left side, and I have this odd numbness in my left arm and left leg also. Again, this has all been going on for about a month. The numbness is very vague - I don't know if I can even classify it as numbness, it's more just this superficial pressure that's going on all along the left side of my face. Again, I'm still perfectly capable of moving everything.

It hasn't stopped me from going into work except for several doctors' appointments, but I mostly just put up with the dizziness. I've never fainted as a result of this (knock on wood). The dizziness is a feeling like I'm on a train or subway all the time - I have a little trouble walking around, it's a balance problem, but I never really lose my balance. The sensation isn't one where things are moving around me - I detect some very slight rocking back and forth side to side when I really focus, but that's it. AntiVert had no effect on this.

I suspected that it might be because of a TMJ issue - since early January I've been dealing with a slight malocollusion in my teeth and suspected that might be because of a TMJ-related issue. My dentists say my teeth look fine, but I'm going to see an oral surgeon with TMJ experience at UPenn the day after tomorrow to see if I can get any answers on this. I'm going to a Balance Center at the hospital next Friday, the 25th.

What I want to rule out is this - I had an MRI on my brain this past Friday, and my physician told me the results came back clean. Some of the symptoms I told you are typical, albeit not sudden (these symptoms have persisted over time), symptoms of a stroke. My blood labs and an EKG all showed completely normal levels of cholesterol and heart rate. Can I rule out an impending stroke with the MRI? Can I rule brain cancer out with the MRI? I'm a little hazy on what an MRI serves to do.

This question is for any eye doctors out there.

I'm posting a question here because I don't know what else to do! I'll just start off with any info that might be helpful:

* I am a 16 year old female
* I wear daily contacts lenses every day for less than a year now. I take good care of them. I don't sleep in my them, I wash my hands before putting them on, and they always feel comfortable. 
* I have never had any problems with my eyes before

**When it happened:**

Yesterday, I took my contacts out before taking a nap. As soon as I took them out, I felt like something was in my eye (I did not feel it while the contacts were in). No big deal, I looked to see if it was an eyelash or something, but couldn't see anything. I then thoroughly took off all my mascara, thinking that was the problem, but still no relief. I was very tired, so I decided to just take my nap. When I woke up, I still felt it. I put in moisturizing drops and it helped for like 5 seconds but then I was back to feeling it again. I tried washing my eyes out with water several times. Admittedly, I also tried rubbing my eyes. I'm sure that isn't the best thing, but it feels like it is high up in my lid and I was trying to bring it down, if that makes sense.

**At the eye doctor's:**

Well, the next morning I woke up to it still being there, exactly like before. It is not painful, my eye is not red or itchy, no discharge. But it is REALLY annoying. I feel it with every little movement of my eyeball and every time I blink. I went to the eye doctor a few hours after I woke up. They are very reputable and well liked. She put something in my eye that makes it easier to see stuff in your eye, looked through the thing with the light at my eye, lifted my lid, and did a ""blind swab"" twice, turning up nothing. She said she couldn't see any foreign body and there was no sign of a scratch or anything.

She sent me home with these thicker, gooier moisturizing eyedrops, but they don't help! 

Tomorrow will be my third day with this horribly annoying feeling like something is in my eye and I feel completely helpless because if the doctor can't help, what happens? I promise I'm not crazy, I am very sure that it at least feels like something is in my eye.

Unrelated but worrying for any podiotrists/foot exorcists protrolling the night: foot ...muscle spasms? started this year, increasing pretty effing rapidly in frequency and duration.

Sometimes I get a dull achy telltale pain, today its been all night and I fear a spasm but so far so good.

 I'm very aware that this sounds highly neurotic and complainy and like it exists in my head as some of my future doctor colleagues have gently and wise old physicianly insinuated, but like seriously... why.  

I'm extremely frustrated and tired of being in constant pain. I dont need a fancy diagnosis, just maybe a detailed explanation of wtf. I feel bad for my friends, who have to be around me while I'm unpleasant and have only one discussion topic. Naproxen, valiant warrior, does not help.

I am a writer and I want to write so badly but cannot focus. Just feel light headed and so blah.

I just started taking allergy med for bad allergies and seems they work but the swimmy head and not being able to focus takes almost all day to go away. Normally by the end of the day I feel better. But, I have had this way before I started taking the meds. It is hard to focus on anything, typing, driving, talking. I just feel out of it.

By the way I have been eating much much better for least two years now and before I did I still had this... so even after eating better and working out more I still feel this way.

I went to a clinic once since I have no health insurance... and this doctor told me to workout and eat better. Which I have been for a long time now and then she said, ""You're just a growing girl. You will grow out of it."" AS far as I know other 22 year olds do not have this problem.

I am 22, not overweight, and 5'7. White if this matters. I wear glasses but around my eyes, forhead etc the feeling of emptiness. By the way I do not drunk, smoke, or do any kind of drug. I don't even drink soda. I drink tea and lots of water.

What is this? I would like to try the clinic because this feeling is really hurting my life. I can't focus on my dream job or normal jobs I have. I just got my first non-retail job and I am so happy but so scared I wont make it because this problem I have everyday. 

i can't take it anymore. I just want to focus and do things.

I've never had any such issues before and I don't know about anyone in the family, either. I was taking the contraceptive Yasminelle, though. Besides the embolism, the doctors found a blood clot in a vein in my abdomen, which they said was older. Anyway, I didn't have any test for thrombophilia yet, because the doctors said that 2-3 months have to pass after the embolism to get proper results. My first question is whether this is correct? Until then I have to give myself heparin injections and I'm a little worried that the test will only be in July.

My doctors first said that after the tests are done, I should take Syncumar, which is a vitamin K antagonist. However, one of my doctors suggested that Xarelto is a better alternative. I've looked it up, but I'm not completely convinced, so I'm interested in your opinions on this drug.

Waiting for the blood clots to disappear before testing for trombofilia sounds sensible to me but I am not a hematologist. I can shed some light on the syncumar vs xarelto discussion:
Syncumar is, as you know a vitamin k antagonist with a strong dose-dependent effect that tends to differ over time. So the downside is that you have to be checked every once in a while that your INR (the units for measuring proper decoagulation) is in the right zone. Too low gives you a higher chance of trombosis, too high gives you a bleeding risk. The upside is that there is an antidote: vitamin K. So if you have to be operated or are bleeding, vitamin K is the treatment to stop the effect of the cumarin. 
Xarelto on the other side does not need the regular checks, it's a sort of one dose fits all anticoagulant (with exception of patients with liver or kidney disease). However, it does not have an antidote and it is new and therefore more expensive. It is very difficult to prove superiority of the new anticoagulants (like xarelto) over classic cumarins in clinical studies. And as it is a new drug, we also do not know enough about the possible long-term consequences of xarelto use. It could be fine, but it could also be worse than vitamin K. 

So all in all you have a well known vitamin K antagonist with known side effects (that are not always harmless) and antidote and a new anticoagulant that is more user-friendly but we are not sure how it will do in the long term.",t3_23a57p,2.0,AskDocs,murpahurp,cguzy5n,1397756058,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,23a57p

Tonight I went out clubbing with some friends, and while I was in the line to the upstairs area of a place I began to feel very very lightheaded to the point that I had to leave.

Here's what happened:

I don't recall why but my friend kind of pushed me into a wall and I hit my elbow on it. I remember as soon as I hit my elbow it felt very different to normal - it felt like i'd hit my funny bone but the effect was much stronger than usual and kind of stinged a little bit. 
And then I began to feel lightheaded... Before this point I was completely fine and had just had a few beers but after hitting my elbow I became very very lightheaded. I became more and more lightheaded until the point where my vision was so 'blurred' that I couldn't see a thing, it was like I passed out but I was still in the line.  I don't quite know how to explain but my vision just became worse and worse and all I saw was blue (like it was a kaleidoscope or something). At this point apparently the bouncer kicked me out and as I couldn't see I basically had to be walked outside by my friends. I just remember my friend saying ""do you wanna go outside"" and I nodded and then I remember being guided outside. And then basically as soon as I got outside I felt completely fine... Very weird that, within about 2 minutes I was completely back to normal..

Anyone got any ideas as to WTF happened to me?

It's been steadily healing without much complaint until yesterday evening/this morning.

It's important to note that your boyfriend doesn't fit the traditional mold of an older, obese person with sleep apnea.  What he truly needs is an overnight sleep study, where he sleeps in a hospital and he can be fully monitored.  He doesn't necessarily need to go to an ENT.  It's important to note an ENT is a surgeon and they will favor surgical therapies.  You should also see a sleep specialist, who often monitors the sleep study, as they will favor nonsurgical therapies.  I believe in getting opinions from both, so as to best understand your options.

My son is 3.5 years old.  He is 36 inches tall and weights 35 pounds.  He had a persistent symmetrical rash and was diagnosed with GCS (Gianotti Crosti Syndrome) at the end of November.  A month later he got an ear infection and the doctors prescribed augmentin and ciprodex.  He had a slow allergic reaction that built up over 3-4 days which was hard to see because of the GCS. His lip blew up on the 4th day and we took him to hospital. They gave him benedryl and prednisolone for 5 days. While on prednisolone he became his old self again. 
Over the next week or so he slips back into rashiness. We took him back to the dermatologist that diagnosed him with GCS and she said it looks like that is gone and replaced by eczema.  He has become extra sensitive to allergies. He always had a little runny nose to common allergens and dogs but now has much more severe reactions.  We had him tested at allergist and his blood work revealed very high IGE and elevated eosinophils.  He was on Zyrtec for nearly 2 months.  He also has a hard time passing stools in general.  Even if he goes daily it can take him up to an hour to pass them.  
In summary, it appears he developed eczema only after a round of augmentin and his allergies became much worse after that allergic reaction to augmentin.  My only thoughts are that his immune system is now stuck in a vicious cycle or maybe the antibiotics destroyed his good bacteria and he now has Candida or something related.  However, he never had diarrhea.  How can we beat back this sudden hypersensitivity and eczema so he can be comfortable again?

Thanks in advance for any insight.

He always had a runny nose to common allergens which means he has always been allergic. Allergic eczema can start in babies (usually on the head) but it is also common for it to start after a child's third birthday. Allergy also does not have anything to do with bad bacteria, especially the eczema. 

Now for the useful advice: You can help your son a lot by removing allergens. This means no carpet in his bedroom and regular vacuuming, if he is allergic to house dust mite there are special covers for his pillow, mattress and blanket. If no pets in the house is not an option, then at least have a no pets in de bedroom rule. A low-dose corticosteroid nosespray can help with the allergic runny nose if it really bothers him. 
Concerning the eczema: vaseline, vaseline, vaseline. Or cetomacrogol, that is less sticky to the vingers. If necessary, up to 8 times a day. Try to keep him from scratching (there are special gloves if he scratches in his sleep). And as long as the eczema is still itchy and irritated: a corticosteroid cream (thin layer!), your dermatologist will know how strong the creme needs to be. 
Do keep in mind that there is a maximum amount of steroids your child can take to assure normal growth. That is also why you have to apply a thin layer of any steroid creme.

The basic premise of applying to medical school is that it is an assumption that everyone is smart, so just getting good grades is far from enough.

You need to be well-rounded and unique.  Write a good essay.  Have a unique life experience.  Have a unique reason for entering medicine.

I spend a lot of time in front of my computer and have been since I started IT studies 4 years ago. I just started working in WebDev a few months ago so these past few months I've been spending at least 7 hours a day in front of a computer and probably about 3-5 hours when I'm home.

I've never had trouble with my knees before. My injury happened when I wanted to start getting back my stamina 2 weeks ago and went on a 5km jog. I barely ran 2 of them and I walked the rest. I also took a few rests in between my runs. In any case, when I took my 2.5km break I felt my calves being really sore. I ran lightly a little and then walked back the rest. I didn't feel anything in my knee.

The next day my left knee started to hurt. I could barely walk. My calves were sore but I've dealt with DOMS before so I wasn't worried about them. I took a break from next week's football and ended up not playing football or running for 11 days. My knee felt completely healed. Then I went out for an hour and a half of football and the pain came back. I played the whole match but it was really uncomfortable by the end of it. That was yesterday. Today my knee feels even worse than last time.

My pain can be described as:

General discomfort. There are very few random positions that I can put my leg in while sitting where I don't feel any discomfort or pain. Walking is impossible without limping. My knee hurts most when I move it (bend or straighten). I'm no doctor but I was looking at [this image](http://www.christuslivewell.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Knee-Anatomy.jpg) and I feel like the pain is probably in my patellar or quadriceps tendon. It's definitely not in any of the ligaments on the side but it may be my ACL or anything from inside my knee. I know I can definitely feel pain if I press upon a certain central position on top of my patella. There is no visible swelling whatsoever though. I can actually sometimes feel it squeak like an old door hinge..

I have to walk 20 minutes to work and back every day, so this is really uncomfortable for me. Can someone please tell me what I should do or at least how long I should rest and how to know when my knee is fully healed?",[deleted],,,,0,,,False,t3_23yy7e,True,False,,,1398453570.0,False,verified-doc,,0.0,t1_ch2og65,Physician,1433532053.0,True,False,1,0,0,t5_2xtuc,t3_23yy7e,False,"I'm not too good with knee diagnoses but I'd say stop walking to work for at least a few weeks (rest it), ice it, put an ACE wrap on it and take some ibuprofen or other NSAID regularly for a few weeks.

I am a smoker (about 8-12 per day for 2 years). 

I have been having chest pains for several months now. I've also had heart palpitations from time to time (for a while I was experiencing them every day but then they stopped and now I only get them from time to time). I've also developed a lump underneath my left nipple that varies in size and and firmness from day to day. It doesn't always hurt but when it does its usually a dull sensation (occasionally, I'll experience a sharp pain). 

I've went to see a cardiologist and they told me all of this is nothing to worry about, and that the pains/palpitations are most likely due to smoking/diet/stress/lack of exercise but it wasn't anything serious. I went to a cancer center where they told me that the lump under my nipple was Gynecomastia.

Now (for the past 2 days or so) I've been experiencing a dull pain the left side of my jaw. Also, the pains in the left side of my chest have been more constant (very dull aching, almost like a type of pressure, if I'm laying on my side or stretch my arms, it really feels uncomfortable and scary). 

I've looked up symptoms of a heart attack and it seems like I'm experiencing them, but the doctors have told me that I really have nothing to worry about (I saw the cardiologist about 7-8 months ago though, so its been a while). I don't know whether I'm being kind of a hypochondriac or whether I need to go to a doctor again.  

EDIT: I've also been experiencing headaches in the back of my head almost every single day for the past 4-5 months. I went to the doctor for that and she said that she doesn't think its anything serious, but she referred me to a specialist that I have an appointment with in June.

Should I go to the ER or am I just convincing myself that I have problems that I really don't?

I am infected with parasites.

Ate raw fish and raw squid/octopus many many times. Loved it. But there laid my demise.  Last one in October 2012 did me in. After eating felt like something crawled into my ears. The months that followed was hell. 

Floaters started to populate my vision - long, tunnel like shapes like some thing's been weaving back and forth. Got tired way too easily. Eyes started to have flickers of flash on the side with crawling sensations in my eyes and became blurry.
Constant crawling sensations in head. Ringing in my ears started ... and when I turn my head sometimes it makes this sick rice Krispy sound and popping sounds are present as well. There are crawling sensations in my ears and nasal cavity and my snot are watery and clear and occurs frequently. 
 


I do not know exactly where the portal of exit was for these critters lay, but pretty soon they started to spread all over my house and constantly on my hair and clothes.

After a few months it was then I realized I was infecting other people who came in my presence. My friend who laid her head on my shoulders got a good whiff of my hair. started to get runny noses with snot that was clear, a symptom I've been having as well. People I meet within SECONDS start developing runny noses or cough a lot- reminiscent of allergies when it's NOT.

I also met this man who helped me transition to a new church. As I wore this cardigan that had been laying in my house for a long time, he started to cough and cough so much after that, all throughout the day. I saw him again a week later and his voice was coarse and still coughing.  Didn't see him for a few weeks and when we met his voice was coarse and he told me he had pneumonia and had to be hospitalized.  He said that he was coughing so much that at night for a week he had to sleep sitting up and when he went to the doctor that's when they saw he had pneumonia.  My heart sank.


another time a relative from another country came to stay at my place. Within minutes of walking in he started coughing and having a runny nose. We bought him allergy meds but that didn't work.  During his week long stay he was sick and constantly coughing. 

When I meet new people they scratch their eyes like something is in them within seconds.  Of course just like how each illness affects each person differently so is the case with this one. Some have minor irritation on their eyes while others will start a runny nose or cough away. 

What have I done about this? Went to my MD initially like a month later after the infection and she looked at me like I was crazy. ""No you are not there's no way parasites can get to your head"" ordered me a stool test and came back negative.  But those things aren't really accurate. Went to the ED in December 2012 and the nurses and doctor didn't take me seriously and overheard a nurse talk about me like a  customer and how satisfaction rates need to be high... 


So now here i am a year and half later infecting others like this ... If there's something I learned from this experience, it is that parasites are EASILY picked up from the environment that we aren't aware of and thinking that they are allergies when they're not. and I'm struggling on what to do. Should i be a hermit? What can I even do as the previous doctors don't take me seriously and I continually infect others? 
I wash my hair everyday before setting foot out the door and still it is not enough because I still spread them evidenced by people scratching their eyes and sniffling/coughing.  Please help.

**why are we so keen to think that parasites are from other countries? Do we not have an influx of immigrants who can harbor parasites without knowingly? Do we not have animals in America? Aren't we surrounded by them who carry parasites as well? What makes you think that you yourself are free from them? I'm willing to bet that many illnesses in the body that cannot be explained are due to these parasites that go undetected from the body's immune system while continuing their havoc. I've lost faith in the American health care system. The doctors are RELUCTANT to believe that this can be true. So me while I CONTINUE to infect innocent others because I can't do a damn thing about it and see them cough and cough, getting allergy meds that WON'T work because it's not allergies, it's parasites!

I never thought of this as an issue because they've always looked this way but the other day I decided to do some research and realized it may be caused by an underlying medical issue. 

I am a 21 year old female, 120 pounds and 5 ft 8in. I have no past medical history that I can imagine would correlate to this issue except I have a history of severe migraines, which I never found the cause of. I've been to a neurologist for the migraines and MRIs showed nothing wrong. Other than the migraines, I can't think of any other medical history that would be relevant. I went to the eye doctor a few months ago and my eyes are fine, besides slight astigmatism. I never mentioned the blue sclera issue to my eye doctor. I also have blue/gray eyes in case that's relevant. 

The research that I've done says this may be due to an iron deficiency which may thin the sclera. My mom always had low iron levels, I don't know if that's something that's genetic. Should I see my primary physician for a blood test maybe? Or my optometrist? I don't think this is an emergent issue but a response back would be seriously appreciated! Thank you.

Hello,

The symptoms started last summer. It was predominantly trouble breathing at first, and diffuse pain in my chest/left arms/jaw/back then and nausea. After a few days of daily massage with a camphor cream, the pain disappeared. I would conclude it was some entangled nerves or something. I decided not to consult a doctor even though that impression of breathlessness persisted. The symptoms above actually lasted a few hours at most and I experienced about 3 of these episodes per day. Then, the symptoms magically disappeared at the end of the summer, except for nausea, which lasted another few months until I stop eating dairy products (possible lactose intolerance?). I had a few episodes of breathlessness in November/December, but they would usually disappear quickly. I guess at this point I concluded it was merely stress. In February, I started to have a pain similar to my chest pain, but in my left knee. It is similar in the way the pain comes and goes quickly, I feel it ""rise"" and it lingers for a few seconds before disappearing. I also noticed the same pain in the lower part of the ribcage. Just like for chest pain, I don't necessarily have to move to experience it. 

Anyway, about a month ago, I was in the shower when I started feeling incredibly weak, it felt like I couldn't quite catch my breath and my vision started turning black. I checked my pulse after the incident: it was normal again, but within the hour, the trouble breathing/pinching sensation in my heart started to become more and more unpleasant, and I started to feel a tingling sensation in my hands. I called 911, the doctor told me it was probably just a panic attack but considering how thin I am, he finally told me to drive to the hospital for some tests. So, I ended up having a EKG, a complete blood panel as well as a lung radiography and everything turned out to be normal, so they told me to go home. Following that, I had many intense episodes during which I thought I was dying, but as I previously said they usually last an hour or so. Now it's been two days I feel considerably worse in the sense the chest and back pain and breathlessness don't go away anymore. I haven't even been able to sleep more than a few hours here and there. I'm quite worried about my health, but don't really want to go at the ER again for 'nothing'. Do you think it presents an emergency? 

Thanks for reading, and for possible advice.

2-3 months ago I had a swollen tonsil and the back of my throat was a mess but there was no fever or anything else besides one single swollen lymph node on the front of my neck, below the thyroid cartilage (same side as the swollen tonsil if that's any important) which didn't even hurt. It was about 1x0.5cm. I don't even know if it was like that before that incident, I just noticed it then. Long story short, because of the lack of fever, no one prescribed antibiotics. After a whole month had passed and my throat was still irritated, a doctor gave me antibiotics for 8 days and finally, it was over. The lymph node remained swollen and hard though. 
About a month later I had a flu (again, no fever or anything else, just an irritated throat) but it went away in 3-4 days. Lymph node still swollen and unchanged.
On top of all that, I had a herpes simplex breakout on my lip 10 days ago, which I mention in case it's relevant.
I visited an endocrinologist who performed an ultrasound. He confirmed it was a lymph node and he told me not to worry about it but he was very very hesitant when he said it. He kept asking if my teeth are healthy and they are. He said it's going to go away on its own, just as it came. The thing is, my dear doctors of reddit, that he didn't explain why it has possibly swollen or what I can do about it (if I can do anything at all). Is there any possibility it's lymphoma? When would it be wise to check it again? How? Blood tests? Ultrasound? Something else?

I think lymphoma is pretty unlikely as you only have one swollen node and a clear history of infections. If you stay worried, you should go back to your doctor.

I don't think you are irrational at all, it's really good you think about these things.

Two flu tests were negative, and a CBC showed only a slightly elevated white blood cell count that was well within the normal levels. Three days later, the fever has gone away, however I have developed a very runny nose (clear mucus, perhaps with the slightest yellow tint) with some congestion. Fatigue has continued throughout.

As long as the fever stays away and you are not getting worse (you might start coughing in a few days but that is quite normal) you should be fine.

Any ideas on what to have our doctors look into would be greatly appreciated.


My wife has been experiencing these symptoms for many years, but in the past 2 years they have become significantly worse in both frequency and intensity.  We have seen several doctors but they all are at a loss and seem very unconcerned since none of her symptoms are particularly terrible - however, they are pretty drastically affecting her daily life.  If anyone has any idea about things to look into and ask her doctor about, we would be forever grateful.


She's 27, 5'3"", 120 lbs.  White, southern california, no current diagnosed issues and no medication.  Up until this last year, when she hasn't been able to because of symptoms, she was very active.  Gym 2x/week, and she dances and choreographs for a living.  She still choreographs and is fairly active despite her difficulties, but less so than before.



**Symptoms:**

* Numbness in fingers, nose, and lips when active or resting (comes and goes, but happens a few times a week and can last all day)
* Feeling faint and dizzy (but has not actually fainted) when active or resting
* Shortness of breath
* Irregular heartbeats (she says it feels like it pauses, and then ""ker-thumps"")
* Extremely tired and fatigued (about 80% of the time)
* Frequently losing her balance when active or resting (she says she feels like she loses her balance sometimes when she's sitting or laying down, which is odd)
* Feeling ""hazy"" in her body
* Heartbeat often slow when she's physically active or very fast when she's resting
* Though she is often sleepy, she sometimes has trouble sleeping through the night or falling asleep - takes melatonin or Zzzquil on occasion, which helps.  Maybe 2x a week for the past 2 months. Not sure if relevant.
* Very frequent muscle twitches - especially in left eye and in fingers



**Things the doctors have checked:**

* Basic blood work - she's not anemic, her electrolytes are normal, not diabetic, and anything else that would come up in that test was normal.  Vitamins B and D were good.
* They gave her an event heart monitor for a month - the doctor thought there may be a structural issue with her heart.  She recorded several episodes but they all were deemed normal and not a heart problem.  
* Heart echo (ultrasound) - normal 
* EKG and stress test - monitored her heart at rest and on the treadmill, normal
* blood pressure, heart rate and breath rate are all within normal range - we have a blood pressure doodad at home and tracked it throughout the day for a couple months, as well as checking at every doctor visit - all normal
* MRI to check for seizures or unusual brain stuff, normal
* given anxiety medication by the neurologist that did not help, went to see a psychologist who did not think she was anxious or had any other mental issue
* tried cutting caffeine from her diet, eating very healthy, doctor had suggested more salt in her diet (?) so we tried that for a while, she drinks plenty of water every day, and keeps her sleep schedule regular (though often so tired/fatigued that she naps during the day as well)



Does anyone have any suggestions about things to look into at this point?  We don't know what else to ask the doctors about, and none of our friends and acquaintances have any ideas.




Thank you so much.



* Not sure if relevant - she and her twin were born very early, given steroids before even born to fully develop their lungs.  Both her brother and her sister have asthma, though she was never diagnosed with it.

It's not a pain that i would crawl down and choke. But i feel it and it's freaking me out. Sometimes i don't even feel it, sometimes it brings the paranoia out of me.

I am 24 years old, male, 5' 9', about 165 lbs, weight, 1+ years duration of complaint, pain in lower right abdomen with diarrhea, no current medication. 

For the past year+ or so, I’ve had intermittent pain centered in my lower right abdomen, maybe 1 inch to the right of my bellybutton. I’ve put off seeing doctor because the pain does go away; only to come back, say 10 or so days later. On top of the pain, I’ve been having diarrhea very often. So much so that my girlfriend now points it out! I am not sure what to do. I don’t want to catastrophize this and take the time away from a medical professional, but the pain won’t go away for good, it always comes back. When it does come back, I generally wake up with the pain, it is sudden, and it throbs and stings as I move throughout the day and then slowly goes away. I’ve noticed that, when the pain is present, if I take deep breaths it becomes worse. 
  
Not sure if this matters but my brother was recently diagnosed with a kidney disease caused by a buildup of protein. Not saying it has anything to do with me. Just thought it would be helpful for someone who reads this to know. 
   
The pain in my abdomen was so shard this morning that I finally called my doctor. I have an appointment tonight at 6:15 EST. 

I don’t want to keep putting this off, but honestly I am second guessing going because now the pain has dulled down.

November 2013: Started to experience pain when walking in my ankles, feet and knees. Went to my University's health center and they said my shoes were too small and my body was compromising, so they prescribed me 600mg of ibuprofen.

December 2013: I travel home for Winter break, on New Year's Eve, my hands blew up and my feet blew up. I couldn't even get out of bed, I cried every time I had to get up to go to the bathroom, I didn't want to eat, I couldn't even move. I wasn't able to grip onto my toothbrush, my fingers wouldn't extend that far. I also couldn't fit my feet into any of my shoes. I had to wear my dad's slippers if I had to leave the house. I went to my family doctor and they prescribed me Tramadol. They did extensive blood and urine tests, but everything came back negative. No lupus, no rheumatoid arthritis, no lyme disease. 
January 2014: I went to a rheumatologist who performed more blood and urine tests, with everything coming back negative once again. By this time I still have the chronic aching pain in my joints, only now it's in my feet, hands, elbows, shoulders, knees, calves and thighs. I also started to get nodules under my skin that were sensitive to touch and my legs broke out in a rash similar to purpura. After the results came back negative again, they decided to just prescribe me prednisone, as the tramadol didn't help at all. My rheumatologist also decided to diagnose me with ""Adult Onset Still's Disease"" but I get the feeling that this is just giving me a diagnosis for the hell of it, as you can't confirm still's disease with a blood test, it's only diagnosed by ruling other things out.

March 2014: Family doctor said I could start to taper off prednisone due to my unhappiness with all of the side effects, including a 10 lb weight gain.

April 2014: I have started to get stretch marks and the prednisone doesn't seem to have the same positive effects that it used to. Occasionally I will still have trouble walking and I won't be able to sleep because I'm so uncomfortable.

May 2014: currently at 17.5 mg per day

We used to fuck like bunnies, at least once a day on average. Neither one of us noticed at first, and then one day my partner told me it had been a week since we'd had sex. I was surprised to realize he was right.

I thought I was stressed, I had a lot going on, and I just figured my libido would bounce back. I tried to make more of an effort, but I felt like I wasn't getting wet and I felt less sensitive/had less blood flow. Outside of sexual scenarios, my vagina had dried noticeably. Once in a blue moon my parts would work and we'd have sex like before, but this became less and less frequent as time went on. Sometimes sex was painful and we'd have to stop. I was moodier than before - I'd snap at little things or cry as if I were pregnant. 

I began seeing doctors at this point, primary care first and then ob-gyn. I was also feeling noticeably stressed and depressed at this point, but the physical symptoms came much earlier. Sadly,when the doctors found out about those feelings, the timeline didn't matter and it was dismissed as ""all in my head"". Later on, I began to have dizzy spells periodically. While I was diagnosed with syncope in 2005, these dizzy spells were different from what I had experienced before. 

We tried all the tips; we used lube, we took it slow, my partner focused on me, and we found alternatives to intercourse. That relieved some of the anxiety I felt toward sex and helped our sex lives considerably, but I was still frustrated. I'd had a strong libido all of my life prior, and now it was gone.

I feared for the worst, began to wonder if I have cancer or something along those lines, but my pap smear yielded normal results. I asked for hormonal blood work at one point but never received it.

It's now been almost three years, and while we've adapted to the situation fairly well, I'm still physically no better off and I've been diagnosed with depression for which I'm being treated. I'm still holding on to hope that something will return me to normal.

Where do I go from here? Endocrinologist? Ob-gyn? My psychiatrist believes there may be a physical cause. Some field of study I'm not familiar with? Any help or recommendations would be appreciated.

Second question, i've been sick for a few days, and it was the worst i've ever experienced. Bloody diarrhea, couldn't eat or drink ANYTHING without vomiting. The vomiting was so bad I vomited until yellow stuff started coming up. That has happened before, but usually not that disgusting. The weird thing is I had terrible stomach pains a few hours before I first vomited.

I'm thinking its food poisoning, but it seems pretty odd to get food poisoning from hot dogs. Everybody in my family even got it.

The source of these extra beats is usually random and, again, very normal.  Alcohol, caffeine, and stress are all able to make these extra beats worse.  The part about this affecting your sleep is more likely related to the stress/anxiety affect than actually being due to the heart beats themselves.  I'm not at all trying to criticize your desire to stay away from the doctor -- I know it's expensive.  However, it's equally important to know when you must go in for assistance if your life is at risk.  You need to learn how to take your pulse so that you can see how rapidly your heart is beating.  If you see average heart rates less than 110 or 120 beats per minute, you're likely fine.  The issue that is challenging is that stress/anxiety can drive heart rates, especially in young adults, well into the 140's and 150's.  So, be careful to watch out for panic attacks.

I would focus on a healthy diet and lifestyle, as I am concerned about your body mass index of 35.6 (obesity is BMI 30-39.9).  Many will question the accuracy of the BMI, often saying they are muscular or 'big boned'.  The ideal weight for your height is 166, with a maximal normal weight of ~180lbs, particularly in a muscular individual.  I apologize for referring to you as obese, but it is a medical term to be used in reference to a particular height and weight.  It can be useful to help shed light on an individual's health and health risk.  Exercise can play a particularly strong role in helping control health risk and controlling stress.

- 230lbs
- Caucasian
- Family history of bone cancer
- No previous health problems


My symptoms -

- On 3/31/14 thru 4/3/14

Every evening before bed my face would flush and begin to tingle

- On 4/4/14

I had a tight neck, confusion, dizziness ,and difficulty comprehending speech in my native language. I went to an urgent care facility and was sent home.

- From 4/5/14 - 4/9/14

I was unable to sit up without extreme dizziness and nausea. I also had neck tightness, and headache that could not be fixed by rest/ ice packs/ over the counter drugs. During this time I was having challenges following the plot in television shows. This is rather odd as I can almost always predict whats going to happen in said shows. I also had feeling of cognitive slowing, as if my brain was taking longer to process information.


- 4/10/14 - 4/19/14

I was able to begin sitting up on a regular basis. My head pain was now reduced to a point where I was no longer constantly icing. The neck tightness was still almost constant and I was having problems going to sleep. I was still suffering from fatigue and nausea. I was also now beginning to be able to watch standard television and hold conversations.


- 4/20/14 thru 4/29/14

Neck tightness and headaches started to be sporadic. I still had a general feeling of mental slowing. I hadnt had any challenges with simple conversations but seemed to get confused easily in more complicated conversations. I had also started to become more active and even simple house work caused me to become mentally fatigued.


- 4/30/14 thru present

Neck tightness and headache are still sporadic. Im beginning to feel more cognitively with it but still feel mentally slow. I worked in the yard yesterday the 2nd for around 5 hours. Im paying for it today with increased headache, and neck tightness all day. OTC pain relievers are beginning to help, but make me feel similar to when I took opiates for my tooth extraction.

We had a couple of people over last night for a cookout, and one of the guests was an 18 year old girl. She had just moved out from her parents house and just started living on her own. At home she was very sheltered and had little or no access to alcohol. 
We'll call this girl Laura. Laura is about 5'6"" and 100lbs..very petite. 

Anyways we had dinner and drinks, and after about 4 beers Laura was.... Lets say pretty well on her way to drunk. She opened a 5th beer and half way through she stopped drinking. 

Shortly after, she basically completely lost it.. Her eyes started rolling back in her head like she was going to pass out, and she started squirming and randomly muttering words etc. 
We decided at this point that we needed to get her to bed. 

We literally carried her downstairs as she was so out of it.. We helped her to the bathroom and had to pull her pants down, put her on the toilet, etc, and provide a puke bucket. She started arguing with and hitting the wall, thinking it was her mother apparently. She also randomly said ""kill me"" several times. 

She vomited twice a short time after and we got her cleaned up. She started saying ""der"" while gesturing towards the sink.. She finally got out ""water"" so we gave her some water and eventually some mouth wash. 

We finally got her into bed and she kept acting like she was afraid and said things like ""don't drown me"" or ""you're killing me"" and kept gesturing with her hands. You could see several emotions flicker through her face but she wasn't making any sense for the most part. We tried to comfort her as she seemed to be afraid of something or someone, as she'd open her eyes and get wide eyed and utter ""no"", etc. If you put your hand on hers she'd latch onto you and squeeze very hard. She randomly shivered but didn't seem to want the blanket on her. 

For obvious reasons we laid right there with her on the bed. She'd go from acting scared, to almost sleeping, and then to ""don't kill me"" to ""what?"" with a blank stare and having mainly the whites of her eyes showing. She seemed to be hallucinating and had very few moments where she actually interacted or responded to us. She thrashed around if you weren't holding her hands. After about 2 hours of comforting her she seems to be sleeping, albeit a little fitfully. 

Now, I've been around drunk people before, but I've never seen this kind of behavior, especially after such a small amount of alcohol. Does this sound like some kind of alcohol metabolizing issue? Does anyone have any input? We are going to advise her to talk to a doctor about this before she drinks again for obvious reasons, but we're curious if anyone has any input on the events.

Some background info first:

- I'm 31, white male, USA
- 5'11''
- 345 lbs (obese)
- history of DVT (twice) and pulmonary embolism (once in 2012) due to Factor V Leiden disorder (didn't find out until embolism). Taking jantoven blood thinner for life and also have a permanent IVC filter installed in my vena cava vein.
- Diabetic type II since 2012 (insulin-supported)
- also take Lisinopril and Atenolol for hypertension 
- family history of cancer 
   - mother died in 2010 from cervical cancer
   - grandmother had skin cancer (survived)
   - grandfather died from complications after brain cancer

(copying and modifying some of this from another post) This entire last month I've had odd chest pain which has never affected me before. It may vary in intensity, however very intense in the sternum then sometimes around the chest wall in front of the lungs, like pressure, burning/stinging or stabbing. Almost like heartburn and also ribs feel sore sometimes. As of now though, most of the rib soreness is gone, but the sternum pain is severe and touching the sternum is a little sore. Its as if the pain changed from chest to sternum/esophagus. I also have burping and I hear intense gurgling in the esophagus and the stomach itself. Having gas sometimes but no bloating. Some frequent urination but not drinking outside of normal ranges. Sometimes get stomachaches too, but no vomiting/nausea. Also have chronic coughing that lasted well before this, but this time it feels dry most of the time. Also have to clear my throat sometimes. Not really hoarse but like mucus is in the way.

Eating doesn't seem to hurt, and I think I'm swallowing ok, but I wonder if it takes longer now for food/drink to go down, or if its just my anxiety right now. The pain is there pretty much every day with an exception of a few days earlier in the month. I only took acetaminophen for it because of all the medicine interactions, and it didn't help much. The only things that DO seem to help are primarily sleeping (laying stomach-side down with pressure on the chest strangely numbs all the pain), or perhaps a hot bath. Still can't tell if antacids have any effect - they kind of don't seem to. Sitting seems to be the worst, regardless of posture. Standing/walking has minimal pain typically.

Went to the ER twice in the last 3 weeks and both times they found nothing wrong. I thought it might be another embolism due to the chest pain, but EKG, blood tests and cat scan are fine. Went to a cardiologist a couple of days ago and getting a nuclear stress test done soon plus another cat scan, just to rule out my heart.

I also visited my primary doctor yesterday, and he said that since I don't have a diagnosis yet, that my anxiety has ramped up and and isn't helping. He mentioned it could possibly be either pleurisy or a gastrointestinal problem and recommended a specialist. In the meantime I'm now taking Prilosec and amoxicillin which doesn't seem to be doing much, although its only been a day. 

Also to note: I used to have some bouts of serious acid reflux in the past 2-3 years but it was never a daily thing; on the contrary it was rather rare. However when it did happen, it was middle of the night, waking to either nasty-tasting bile that burned, or it was something blocking my breathing (perhaps the bile) and I had to cough like hell to clear my airway. I also had a scary run-in with coughing up blood once about 1.5 months ago, and it was isolated. I'm almost positive it came from my lungs as I felt 'bubbling' in my lungs as I exhaled, and the ER just thought it was from my jantoven blood thinner or popping a blood vessel from coughing. 

So right now I was googling symptoms (which I probably shouldn't) and saw that it could either be GERD or Esophageal cancer. The latter is quite literally scaring the hell out of me, given my family history of cancer and also that I an obese male which increases my risk (although I don't smoke and rarely drink).  

I want to get tested for this ASAP with an endoscopy and such. Of course I can't schedule anything until Monday and every second that passes is making me ill. The constant pain has already driven me to madness and if its cancer well then...I just don't know anymore.

Thank you for reading this...

I've had pretty bad acne for years and years and because of it I stayed inside a lot. A real lot. I think I stayed inside for about 4 years without going outside at all, even for 5 minutes.

Over that time my acne got worse and worse and I started developing other symptoms such as allergic reactions to foods containing fat. Whenever I'd eat anything with fat in it I'd get a red rash around my nose that would last for 2-3 days.

Eventually it got worse and worse and I realized that I might be deficient in Vitamin D so I took supplements and the rash stopped appearing and my acne got a bit better. I believe this is because vitamin D has an anti-inflammatory effect and stops the immune system from over-reacting.

However, my acne was still a problem and having tried various creams I went to a dermatologist and she gave me some antibiotics to try. 

So I start taking them and I notice strange symptoms like my nose turning red again and my whole face would get really red at night and would feel like it was burning. My nose also started running whenever I ate anything (literally I'd eat a banana and 1 minute later my nose would start running). My right hand also turned red and started swelling up and getting sore, sort of like arthritis.

So I went to the doctor and told her all my symptoms and she ran a test (general test and inflammation test) and she said everything was fine and didn't know what was causing my problems.

After taking the antibiotics for 5 months (which didn't help my acne at all), I stopped taking them. I read online you should take probiotics after you finish a course of antibiotics so I ate a probiotic yogurt every day for 2-3 weeks.

It's now been over a month since I stopped taking the antibiotics. Here's my symptoms now:

- My face is still turning red all the time for no reason. The left side of my face has a permanent red patch.

- My legs have red patches all over them which disappear randomly every 5-6 hours and then come back.

- My right hand still is red compared to my left hand and is stiff/hurts to move my fingers a bit.

- I get small red hives/spots all over my arms/hands whenever I go outside (photo sensitivity probably)

- My skin is peeling off on my right hand (also my nose sometimes as well). Literally my skin is falling off in patches.

- My nose STILL turns red whenever I eat anything with too much fat in it (which I try to avoid). Meat for example will make my nose turn red the next day. Probably the worst symptom. I don't know of anyone who has this.

- I still have acne and my skin is SUPER oily

- I have to pee all the time.

- My tongue is literally yellow. I also get yellow patches of skin all over my face. I think it's some sort of fungal infection but idk what to do about it.

What the hell am I supposed to do? I try to eat healthy, avoid fat, get out in the sun for vitamin D, exercise, drink probiotic yogurt drinks...what else can I do? I feel like staying inside for 4 years has destroyed my immune system and now I'm fucked. I've tried all kinds of supplements...zinc, vitamin A/C/D/E, fish oil and others.

My doctor doesn't have a clue what's wrong with me, my dermatologist is useless and wants to give me more antibiotics for my acne. I asked her about my face/nose turning red and she just shrugged.

Honestly I've been dealing with this crap for years and I can't take it much longer. I have to avoid people because I look like total shit. I can't live a normal life like this. I have no friends at all and I have absolutely nothing left to live for. I feel utterly hopeless.

I doubt anyone has any idea what I should do but I might as well post this as I'm out of options and won't be around much longer if I don't start getting better.

I used to just pick out the dirt and skin with my fingers every once and a while.

2 months ago i had burning between my pinky toes. Started spraying between all toes with Micatin. Once after shower/blow dry and once before changing socks for bed.

Went to the clinic and the doc didn't even look at my feet. Said that it sounds like athletes foot and keep doing what im doing. So i did. 

A few weeks later i noticed my feet where looking pretty dry. Read something online that said %70 of people that think they have dry feet actually have AF. 

Went to the clinic to ask. Dr actually looks at one of my feet and between my toes. Says its hard to say for sure and to keep spraying between toes and the dry parts of my feet.

Switch to Tinactin (on sale at the time). Spray between all toes, ball, heel and sides of feet (mostly the front near the toes) for a couple weeks. Once after shower/blow dry and once before changing socks for bed.

After 7 weeks (total) of spraying i go back. Still feels weird between my toes. I think its the spray but what to i know. Dr looks at my other foot and says hard to say for sure and to stop treating and see what happens. So i stop.

That was a week ago. Between both my pinky toes feel better, but not perfect. Sorta the old gunky feeling plus when i spread them really wide it feels like a ripping sore. It's not open. Girlfriend says it just looks a little dry in there. The rest of my right foot look like this.. http://imgur.com/a/kd0Tg#0 The left is the same just not quite as bad. Does not hurt or itch. I wouldn't even know it was there if i didn't look one day.

It was an unusually dry winter here.. And since having jock itch a month or so before having athletes foot (or not) i have been bathing a lot more then normal. So i don't know if its super dry from bathing more often (plus the daily blow drying and talc from the spray) or AF from bathing more often :(

I have been really paranoid about it for 2 solid months. Worried its going to spread all over me, my girlfriend and pets from the sheets, comforter or floor. Worried im spreading it all over the apartment. Worried pets are picking up spores and putting them all over the house, bed, pillows, clothes, couch... me..

I have changed my diet since years ago from very bad to good and getting more healthier. And I work out... well lately been slacking because I started my first non-retail job. But, trying to work working out into it. Anyways So, I am 22 and not over weight.  I do not drink or smoke or do drugs. I only drink tea with no sugar... my only source of caffeine. I hardly eat fast food. Normally once a month sometimes twice.

Okay, so this is what happens... I wake up and sometimes I have a head ache because I clinch my teeth at night. Sometime I feel perfectly fine. Like this morning... no head ache. I got up cooked breaskfest... which was Three turkey bacon, a egg, two small pancakes with real maple syrup. I also ate a banana and some grapes. I drank some caramel ice coffee too (which this is the first time I have had this drink in a long time) and felt fine. I was stting there watching neflixs when I started feeling my head slowly starting to feel full and pressure on it. Then it gets woozy then my body starts feeling odd. And now I feel as if I am all shaky on the inside and my breathing is a bit odd. Does not hurt to breath but it is a little bit different... no idea how to explain it. But, like my air way is open a lot and hard to breath even though I can? I  haven't ate any salt if this helps to figure it out... So, head is woozy, cannot focus, body feels all shaky and racy inside, and breathing odd, and heart is little strange and fast beating.

yesteryday I ate the same thing expect no grapes and drank tea. Normally I drink tea, milk,v8, or water in the morning. And this happens with different things I eat and ONLY in the morning. Now I am sitting here all shaky inside, head woozy, breathing little odd, and heart kinda meh. ANd this feeling will last ALL day long. By maybe 6ish/7ish it may go down a bit. 

Now, this happens randomly... and I am trying to remember if it happens before I eat too... I think it happens in morning before I eat too sometimes. But, I can't take this anymore. I take clarinet D... just started it but note that this stuff has happened without it. This has been happening since I had a bad diet and with a good diet.

What could it be? I am going to the doctor in three weeks... but I can't take this. I may lose my new job because when this happens I feel as if my body is going to flip on me or I will faint. It holds me back with working and doing anything. Sometimes if I move fas the feeling is not so bad but still there. I was hoping this would be a good day... but now I know this feeling is going to be here all day long and ruin anything. 

With this feeling I lose focus and get very pissy. I have low tolerance for anything. I don't want to live like this anything anymore. I know wait to doctor but I go to a clinic and they hardly give two shits about you. But, maybe this time will be different.

I do have anxiety problems but today I am off and not doing much and was just chilling, eating, and enjoying my netfix, then I finished my food and bam it all hits.

TL;DR - Doc told me its 50/50 lymphoma or cat scratch induced lymphadenopathy (benign.)  Do swollen lymph nodes from infection look like normal lymph nodes only larger on ultrasound?

Stats: 
29, male, 5'11, 220lbs, white/hispanic, 3wks, left side groin (just inside of left hip), no meds, no history - 

So I noticed this mass while putting on my pants, no pain (though over the last week i have noticed some dull pain in my left testicle), no symptoms, no other swollen nodes, no recent illness.  I got it checked out, my doc suggested blood work and a CT scan.  Blood work is completely normal.  CT scan revealed several other enlarged nodes in that area (though they are not clumped or matted together) - upon seeing the CT results, doc suggested that I get a biopsy.  Saw a surgeon this morning, ultrasound was done (i've got potato quality pic of the screen that I can link if you want me to) and as soon as she saw the screen said ""yep, thats not normal, lets get that biopsy.""

I have already been freaking out about this since my doc first told me to get a CT.  Now that cancer is officially on the table I'm really freaking the fuck out. I know that i should just wait for my results and stop trying to figure this out on my own, but i've come to a stopping point in my research and there is one questions that I can't figure out.  the enlarged lymph nodes are due either to lymphoma or cat scratch disease.  i got a pretty good look at the ultrasound, and now I'm trying to determine how enlarged lymph nodes present when caused by CSD infection. do they present the same only enlarged?  is it easy to distinguish between malignancy and infection via ultrasound?

The surgeon told me that they have been times where she's seen ultrasounds and knew visually that it was lymphoma.  is it possible that this is the case (maybe not as severe) and she wanted to be sure?  What are the real chances (she said 50/50) that this is malignant?

Hi,

I have a swollen lymph node just above the left side of my collarbone, which I believe my GP said was a supraclavicular node. It first appeared swollen (by which I mean it is easy to feel, and obviously different to the right hand side) about a year and a half ago. I was referred for an ultrasound, where I was told ""I can't find it, there's nothing there"". Fairly sure that's because the guy was scanning my neck and chest, rather than the actual area, but there we are.

It then either disappeared, or I stopped noticing it. 9 months ago it reappeared/I noticed it again (I don't have a habit of feeling my collarbone...) and went back to the GP, as I also had a lump in my breast. I was referred for another ultrasound, as well as surgery to remove the lump. The lump was biopsied and found to be benign, and whilst the person doing the ultrasound did manage to find the lymph node this time, they said it ""was an infection"", despite it having been there over 3 months by that point and me not having had any sign of illness over that period, nor the previous time it had swollen. I accepted it, thinking doctors know best.

Last night, I noticed it was swollen again. I was not going to go to the GP, as I would feel embarrassed going for the same thing yet again. However, my mother has just been diagnosed with colorectal cancer, so I am a little wary about everything right now. I also read a post on here just now, where somebody mentioned that a scan can not tell if the lymph node is an infection or not. I was hoping someone may be able to offer any advice - is it worth going back to my GP, or was the person who did the ultrasound correct, and I have a seemingly-invisible infection?

I can't feel any other nodes, and the GP did not feel any others when she felt them last time. The swollen node is only about 1cm, I think, though I can't really measure it because I'm incompetent. It's hard, but not painful or even tender, and it is quite movable. I have no other symptoms at all.

I take sertraline for depression and propranolol for tremors (no diagnosis for this yet, going back to neurologist next week, don't think they're connected). Long history of depression and an eating disorder, although my weight is currently pretty stable.

A few points of note, however.

Infectious nodes can stay ""up"" for a long time or even permanently after an infection. It can also come and go because of changes in body position, body habitus, and how carefully you are looking so while yes, coming and going means it is very unlikely to be cancer, it is tougher to say it is *truly* coming and going, particularly from a self exam. That said, everything else you said about the cancer and likelihood is correct, save the fact that Virchow's node is almost exclusively a *stomach* cancer indication, rather than a colon or other gut cancer. Stomach cancer, particularly in young people, is rather rare. 

Also, touching it will not change it or make it worse. If it is tender, obviously that will aggravate it, but she is saying it is non-tender. And even then it really isn't a big deal.

No, scans cannot differentiate between swollen nodes. You need a biopsy for that. 

If it is genuinely concerning to you, bring it up with your GP and ask if (s)he would advise a biopsy. That will settle it pretty well. 

The fact that this has been going on for a long period of time and you have been seeing a GP is reassuring. If it were something sinister, over this length of time you would have other symptoms that would have flagged your GP's attention (like unintended weight loss, night sweats, difficulty swallowing, and a few others).

I don't drink or smoke. 2 years ago I had a painless kidney stone which blocked my left kidney(Hydronephrosis). Unfortunately as I did not feel any pain during the incident, it didn't get diagnosed in time and my left kidney is now damaged (My urologist estimated that it's only working 25%). My right kidney is still 100% healthy. I also have elevated uric acid. Cholesterol and blood sugar are all normal.

I've been having high blood pressure for the past 2 years, . My blood pressure daily usually hovers around 140/90 ~150/100. On some stressful days, it can get to 160/100.

I've seen several doctors and all of them said it's genetic. I'm currently taking Coveram 5/10 which lowers my blood pressure a bit to 130/80. They all recommended me to lose weight so I decided to do regular exercises (3 times a week, thai boxing &amp; brazilian jiu jitsu classes). I weighed 220lb  8 months ago and has since lost 30 lb. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to help with my blood pressure as it's still hovering around 140/90~150/100.

One thing I noticed is that if I take my blood pressure 1 hour after exercising, my blood pressure is very very good (115/75). When I take my blood pressure again the day after, it usually goes back to 130/90 or 140/90.

I've informed my doctor about this and all he said was ""That's why you should exercise regularly!"". I'm just wondering if there's any medical/scientific explanations.

The most likely physiological explanation is that when you exercise all of your peripheral blood vessels dilate and increase the capacity for blood flow. Your heart rate and blood volume pumped out per beat also increases so that your blood pressure (should) stay roughly the same. After you stop exercising, your heart rate and stroke volume will decrease faster than your peripheral blood vessels will re-constrict. Thus, you will be pumping (relatively) less blood into a larger volume and decrease your blood pressure. This could be just entirely normal - the way your body is - or, more likely, as an effect of the drug you are taking. Coveram is a combination ACE-I and calcium channel blocker. Your muscles - including those that constrict to shrink your blood vessels back down - use calcium to function. That is why we give calcium channel blockers for blood pressure - it makes your blood vessel muscles less able to constrict down, increasing their volume, and thus decreasing blood pressure. The calcium channel blocker is likely just slowing the ability of your blood vessels to return to normal tone after exercise, hence your notably lower blood pressure at that time. There are other possible causes, but this is the most likely. 

After you lose the weight, you may find that you no longer need the blood pressure medication. It could take a long time after you have lost the weight - years even - or more quickly. The first signs that this would be the case is feeling lightheaded or dizzy on standing. Or you may need to be on the medication for life to control it. The point is either way you should keep up with the exercise and weight loss and maybe, with a little luck, that will tip your body enough to have normal or almost normal blood pressure and you can get off the Coveram. Cross that bridge when you get there. 

As for your kidney - that is almost certainly not causing any problems. You still have a huge amount of kidney reserve and will likely not have any problems as a result of your hydronephrosis. It is something to watch, however, as later in life it may become relevant. ",t3_24wrtp,2.0,AskDocs,nybgrus,chbtkc4,1399472152,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,24wrtp

Well, that's not entirely true. Obviously the *way* in which you do it could lead to trauma - either in the penis itself or in the wrist from a repetitive motion injury. But barring those things, there is nothing at all to indicate that it could be harmful nor that stopping would bring you any benefit.

Probably the reason why it happens when you are just flexing and not when you are doing physical labor is because in the latter you are flexing all the surrounding muscles to stabilize the joint preventing it from entering the paraphysiologic space. In just flexing, those muscles are relaxed, allowing for the bicep to move the humeral head further, thus causing the cavitation.

If you are unable to stop vomiting and/or become dehydrated because you can't keep anything down, you should go to an ER. Dehydration from vomiting can be particularly dangerous because of electrolyte disturbances. 

In the meantime, try and relax and drink fluids (not water, but things like gatorade - and not the diet gatorade) but slowly. Take small sips every 30-60 seconds, not big gulps.

I exercise regularly, weightlifting and cardio 3 times a week. Currently bulking. 

All my meals are cooked by me. Eggs, chicken breasts, controlled carbs. High protein, high calorie. 2 months ago for a period of 6 months my diet was high protein, low carb, low calorie as I lost 20 pounds on a cut. Before that I had an uncontrolled diet and was overweight (180lb high bodyfat %). 

I am almost always tired. I feel like I am living in a fog. My emotional state is either angry or apathetic. I have a slow reaction time on the road. I am not lazy, but I am lethargic. I have had this problem for at least 5 years, possibly longer. 

I have this problem despite the amount of sleep I get. 6 hours, 8, 9, same feeling (6 is more intense exhaustion). Played with REM cycles and tried 7.5/9.5, same feeling. No matter how many naps of various lengths I take, same feeling.

Suspected sleep apnea. Recorded myself and heard snoring, this runs in line with what I've heard from partners. Treated my extreme allergies with antihistamines (non-drowsy) and steroid nasal sprays. Slight nasal drip but no more snoring. Still sleepy. 


My diet is healthy. I get regular exercise. I have a 15% bodyfat percentage. My sleeping conditions have been perfected: No lights, no sounds other than a fan blowing on me, no mid-night interruptions. According to all my research, I should be as alert as a hummingbird on coke. Yet, I am still tired. 

I want to explore other options. I have a resting heart rate of 48, which has not changed between me being fat and healthy, so I suspect there might be something there (cardiologist said it was no problem). Another cause could be history of depression in my family and myself, but even when I am really wanting to be happy, there is that fog in the way. I feel like it must be more than just mental, it feels like something physically holding me back from my alertness potential. 

The weird thing is that despite all my efforts, experiments, and body-health changes, I am still always tired. I seem to get no results whatsoever. 

Any off-the-wall suggestions are appreciated. My next step is to get a blood test for diabetes, something I don't know much about but I feel like my cardiologist or *someone* would have caught in the past 5+ years. The reason for this is that some days aren't consumed by lethargy, but have periods of high alertness that consistently and without fail fall into lethargy somewhere between 2 and 4pm. This is consistent despite my sleeping patterns so I suspected something about my diet or eating patterns that are beyond simply eating healthy.

A few days ago i noticed that the right side of my tummy, starting in the lower right quarter of my belly button and going about two - three inches down and about the same to the right, maybe a bit further, was swollen. It isn't super noticeable unless you look right in my belly button because I have some tummy fat, but the right is absolutely swollen. It is not a lump, but honestly just feels like fatty tissue or water retention. It isn't very tender, sometimes it feels like there is a bruise but there isn't, there is a spot that seems more tender. I have had this sharp tearing pain but it is very random and hasn't been bed enough for an ER visit. When I walk it hurts but it is very dull. 


I have a doctors apt on monday but I am worried that this could be something bad.

I am not sure if this is related but it seems like it is (TMI sort of period stuff below just a heads up...)


I usually have normal/ heavy periods that last about 5-6 days. This time it started off very light, the next day i had about 12 hours of soaking a regular tampon in like an hour and a half (this is really unusual) and then it tapered off that night. The bleeding only lasted 2-3 days and the last bit was this strange copper color as opposed to bright red or brown. This is pretty strange for me.


None of these things are bad enough to send me to the ER but they are a bit worrisome. While the belly doesnt cause me constant pain it still just feels strange..

male

82 kilos(180.4lbs), 182cm(+-6 ft)

5 years+

Netherlands, Europe

I've been tested multiple times for diabetes over my life when I talked to my doctor about this, never tested positive. 
I almost exclusively drink water, with the exception of milk and thee. I don't drink coffee any more as this made my symptoms worse. The doctor suggested to drink less and let my body get used to it but I'll get headaches, dizziness and be constantly thirsty if I drink less.

Some other things that might be related are:
I sweat a lot when working out or when the weather is hot, I mean my shirts can look like I went swimming in them. 

I am almost always hot when most of my family or friends aren't, my ideal room temperature is about 18 °C(64.4F).

I am very susceptible to heat exhaustion and to a lesser degree heat stroke when outside in the sun in temperatures above 30 °C(86F). Daily intake of water in tropical and or hot environments exceeds 6 litres.

Ironically, my core temperature is on the low side around 36°C (96.8F). I almost never have a fever, even why my infected appendix was removed I wasn't showing any sign of fever. Excluding once when I had a 42.3°C(108.14F) fever following a lung infection.

The reason why I want to solve this problem is that it hard to keep up this intake when traveling and the need to constantly drink is annoying. Especially considering I usually wake up twice a night to drink. During a typical night I'll empty a half litre bottle of water. Moreover, I need to keep track of my salt intake, as this sometimes isn't enough to keep the appropriate levels up.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

I had a sexual health screening about 3 weeks ago and all results came back negative. I then stupidly had unprotected drunken sex with the person I am seeing (I have only had 3 sexual partners and was always safe until this point). I then decided to get tested again just to be 100% sure. Sure enough, I was told I have Gonorrhea.  I got the treatment the day after finding out (ceftriaxone 250mg intramuscular and azithromycin 1g orally) on wednesday the 7th may. I had diarrhea about 2-3 hours later. This is now 4 days later (sunday the  11th of may) and I feel like symptoms have persisted. Before, my symptoms mainly consisted of anal itching and burning and some bleeding, which has now gone. (The unprotected sex incident was also the first time I decided to try anal, idiot IDIOT me) However I now have vaginal itching , redness, white gooey discharge (i'm sorry), and frequent urination. Does this mean that the treatment has failed? I am going back to the doctor as soon as I can. Is there any more treatment options for me or will I be stuck with Gonorrhea for life?

 As a side note, I am currently doing my exams and I was wondering if I could have contributed to my persisting symptoms, such as the occurrence of thrush, as I have read that it can be stress related, and I am VERY STRESSED. (I also suffer from depression and am currently on Lexapro)

 As another side note, I experience recurring UTI's, I have had about 6 in the past 2 years, for which I have taken antibiotics for each time. Could this intake of antibiotics be a factor in the treatment failure for Gonorrhea?

About 3 weeks ago I started feeling a swollen lump on the left side of my neck at the base just above the clavicle. I assumed it was just a swollen lymph node but it didn't go away. It tends to fluctuate in size and it seems like the more I touch it, the larger it gets for some time. It is very tender and can be somewhat painful when pushed.

I went to see a doctor a few days ago and he was relatively sure it was just a lymph node from a latent infection. He did request a blood test just for peace of mind though. I have not received the test back yet. 

My concern is due to the fact that I have never had that particular node swollen and no lymph node swelling has ever lasted more than a few days with me, let alone 3 weeks.

The lump is pliable and I did have some pain radiating down my arm a few days ago, though it passed. Currently, it's a bit uncomfortable to move my neck (not painful though).

It seems to have gotten a little larger overall and more tender since my doctor visit. Does anyone have any idea what this could be?

So I'd love some input here. It is driving me nuts, and doctors have run batteries of tests. 

So far, my symptoms are: dizziness/vertigo, constant pressure in the right side of my head, ear and neck base, sometimes I have odd phenomena when walking (but not running), tinnitus, pins and needles in feet and hands (VERY rarely) and general issues with my balance.

Two head CT scans showed absolutely nothing. Heart tests came back fine, abdominal ultrasounds showed all of those organs are fine, breathing is fine as well. Absolutely nothing showing on a four different blood panels, as well. Been experiencing very slow, increasing symptoms for two years, now.

If anyone has any ideas whatsoever, please let me know. My friend in med school's only suggestion is a CT of my cervical spine and neck, although I don't see why that would correlate. 

Thanks in advance.

I have been researching all over the internet and don't find any advice that I am not already doing. 

First off, this is me:

- 157-160 cm tall (not quite sure/depends on my posture on a given   day)
- 20 year old female
- 64kg (a bit heavy for my height, I know)
- ""hourglass shape"" but probably considered a bit overly chubby
- large breasts (DD) that bother me 
- thighs touch when I walk and I hate it
- don't drink alcohol, smoke or take drugs 
- been vegtarian for several months
- thirsty all the time and drink a lot of water 
- recently became vegan/gluten-free
- avoid processed food, sugar and soy products as much as possible
- have trouble sleeping
- bloated feeling
- constipated 

I have always had a curvier figure. I didn't have much of a weight problem till recently. I ate what I wanted and stayed under 60kg which I was reasonably happy with. Sometimes I felt a bit heavy so I would just be more careful with what I ate and I'd lose a few kilos. Towards the end of last year, I started to notice I was gaining weight (which I believe is common for college students) I didn't care that much until my clothes started feeling tight and started to hate the way I look in the mirror. It really hit me when I started to hear some friends making comments about my weight. I didn't have a really bad diet and exercised occasionally. 

I ate a lot dairy and processed foods but not much else. When I started to notice the weight gain I started being more careful. I've never felt comfortable eating animals so I became vegetarian (four months ago?). About the same time, I took up boxing training 1-2 times per week (something I've always wanted to do). Normally this would be enough to make me lose weight but no weight will budge. I started going to the gym as well (3-4 times a week for 1-2 hours at a time). Improved muscle tone and posture but no weight loss. When my exercise levels increased, I notice I became thirsty all the time and have to drink water constantly throughout the day to feel sufficiently hydrated and have to pee every hour.

 I noticed I was really constipated (not having a bowel movement for a week(I have had this problem a lot in my life but notice it more so within six or seven months)) and I have been anemic most of my adult life (very pale skin, bad hair and nails). I read it's often a sign of gluten and/or lactose intolerance so I decided to give up wheat and dairy and see if it helps. When I gave up bread and dairy, I lost 3kg almost immediately but gained it back again just as quickly. I felt a bit healthier but was still suffering the constipation so started eating prunes (I don't want to have to take laxatives or anything). After a couple of days of eating prunes I am having bowel movements a lot but it is like a thick paste that is very hard to pass and causes pain and never feel like I have actually emptied my bowels. 

I am in the process of receiving medical tests for various things. A while ago (2012?) I had tests for the thyroid hormones and had elevated T4 but the blood test I had recently showed normal hormone levels. I have generally always had a low glucose level and recently was tested for insulin resistance and my body has normal insulin response. My doctor said I might have celiac disease or hashimoto's but I am still getting tests done. Even if I have a condition like that, I can't see how I could possibly be retaining this weight with my diet and exercise levels. I eat mostly fruit, vegetables and occasionally rice. There's no way I could be eating excessive calories. The only thing I ""over eat"" would be vegetables like capsicum, carrot and lettuce because I know these things are nutritious and don't have many calories. I heard rice is good for digestion, weight loss and general health so I am going to start eating a bowl of brown rice everyday and see if that helps. 

Sorry for long post, just wanted to include as many relevant details as possible. Please help me. I just want to be fit and healthy and not have a flabby body. It's driving me crazy. Thank you.

Also, just as /tinijabroni pointed out - you need to actually keep track of all the calories you are taking in rather than just assume. You'd be surprised at how many calories people can leave unaccounted for. Particularly since fruits are actually very calorie dense. Prunes are in the top 3 most calories dense fruits, bananas in the top 10, and so on.

I’m not seeking medical advice from internet strangers. However, I am definitely looking to see if anyone has had the same experience and what solutions (if any) they’ve found.

My wife and I have just gotten back from her laparoscopic procedure to look for endometriosis. It turned up nothing. The doctor found no signs of any unhealthy organs, no endometrial growth, no cysts, not anything abnormal at all. Everything is “normal” and healthy looking.

Prior to today, my wife has been suffering four years of intense gastro problems (gastritis, acid reflux, duodenitis, IBS, and so forth). Her gastroenterologist is doing her best to treat these problems, which are generally under control except before/during/after menstruation.

My wife also has extreme pelvic pain before/during/after menstruation. She also has pain during sex. 

She has undergone a battery of tests on blood and urine, CT scans, transvaginal ultrasounds, and now the laparoscopy. Again, everything is “normal”. She has no signs of cancer, endometriosis, cysts, etc.

The past years have forced her to quit her job, halt her educational plans, and so forth. Despite that, she has always talked about those hurdles as temporary. Today, my heart broke when I met up with her in post-op, because she just kept crying, asking “How can there be nothing there? Why does it hurt so bad if nothing is there?”, and talking about her life plans now as something she “was” going to do.

My question is simple: has anyone suffered these symptoms, found nothing from the OB/GYN route, but then gone to some sort of other specialist and actually discovered the source of the problem?

We need new routes to explore.

Thanks.

Treatment can consist of psychotherapy (it's amazing what the mind can do with pain, it can make it both worse and better) and you can also think of seeing a pain-specialist (anesthesiologist with special interest field) to see if any local nerves in the area can be numbed.

On *only my right hand*, I have developed several blister-like things. They feel like blisters, but are mainly filled with the underlying swollen skin rather than fluid. They are not particularly warm, but do itch. The ones close to my knuckles have swollen the skin enough to make it difficult to bend the affected finger; when I do bend it, it feels ""tight"", if that makes any sense.

I have, in the past, gotten very small, hard blister-like bubbles here and there on my fingers, that itch terribly and fade away after a week or so. This time however, it seems like a bunch of smaller bubbles have combined their powers to create some super blisters.

I am very right hand dominant, so I had been thinking this is related to me obtaining and using a new drawing tablet with [this pen](https://store.wacom.com/us/en/product/KP501E2/).. maybe I'm reacting to the rubber grip? However, there are absolutely no blisters on the undersides of my fingers, and the existing blisters are not located where my fingers make contact with the pen.

There is nothing else new in my environment, and I rarely leave my home (work from home, too hot out) for there to be an outside factor.

I use special, gentle hand lotion and whatever Target brand green-coloured liquid hand soap.

I just suffered from it just now, just showered, and need to post this.

I have to go #2 about once a week, and when I do sometimes it gets really bad. Let me tell you the process I have to endure each week. I just took a horrible one just now and I'm wearing plastic gloves to not contaminate anything....

I sit down on the toilet, grit my teeth horribly, strain my head and push as hard as I can. This usually gets a bit out, but there is a huge mass left to get rid of.... Now this is where it gets gross. Sometimes I am forced to dig out the remaining shit with my hand, to help get it out. This usually helps a bit and then finally when I push super hard it falls out. I look in the toilet and I can't even believe it made it out... it is a hard mass, not soft poo like it normally should be, but extremely hard, with some blood. It is a big relief it gets out, but at the same time I feel like I am damaging my health. 
 This routine has been happening frequently. I have probably had these nightmare #2 sessions about 10-15 times I believe since I started my subutex maintenance. I Let me say I cannot get off it at the moment as it does help me stay clean, this constipation is the #1 downside however and I HATE IT. 


this usually clogs the toilet and I am sweaty from exhaustion and am deeply worried of how this affects my mental health. I just took a shower and washed my hands about 10 times with tons of soap to get the crap out of my fingernails (sometimes a tissue doesn't suffice and i actually have to use my fucking nails... I'm sorry if this is gross but it's true and I want to know how bad this is for my body and brain). 

I did read that constipation causes mental fog, and I have experienced that. Also drowsiness, it is extremely hard for me to get up in the morning these days. How about my teeth and the veins in my head too? I clench extremely hard with my teeth just to take a shit, and my veins feel like they are going to explode. **I feel like I am doing a considerable amount of damage to my head, teeth, and colon**. Is this severe? I am not lying about any of this and I posted on an anonymous account due to my embarrassment.

But yeah, so I am female in early twenties of healthy weight, no health problems, occasionally active and doing sports, but never overstraining my body. I wear mostly well cut well supporting shoes outside, and no shoes at home.         

Ever since I can remember, once in a while (like once a month or so), I'd get this foot spasm in my right foot. Always the right foot - it just becomes pretty painful and involuntarily clenches for couple of seconds.     
This happens: a) completely randomly - e.g. even when I'm in bed, b) while I do some physical activity - but that activity is not extremely straining on the feet - it can be yoga, or light cardio at home &amp; c)during sex (to be fair, I think I often sorta clench my feet during the deed and forget about it, so maybe that strain could cause that in that situation).     

I never paid much attention to it, but today it happened while I was doing some light cardio and I did some symptom googling, and one of the things that keeps popping up is Parkinson's. My grandpa had Parkinson's (yet it started in his sixties).       
So, what do you think: am I a victim of the typical * *has flu symptoms ---&gt; goes to WebMD --&gt; oh, it must be cancer* * mindset, and are these kind of cramps and spasms more common than I think, or should I be worried and talk to a doctor re parkinson's?

I've applied it for several days and it has in the last few days it's formed a larger scabbed area and become a little uncomfortable. Finger is feeling warm and slightly itchy. Infection maybe?

I'm unsure if I should stop applying this stuff and let it dry out or keep going. Looking back I should have gone straight to the GP and had it frozen off.

I've been to a number of Dr's, none of which have pinpointed an issue. 

I've been heavy since I was in my mid-20's. Around 2003-2004, when I was 37, I started to lose weight - about 60 pounds. One day, I went to the restroom and got sick with both diarrhea and vomiting at the same time. Lasted about 15-20 minutes. Thought it was odd out of the blue, but didn't think too much of it otherwise. Until it started happening all the time. It would come on out of nowhere and there was nothing I could do. I've missed business meetings and even a flight once.

Went to the Dr, which led to gastric bypass. I had other issues going on that caused the Dr to recommend the surgery. Keep in mind that this ""sickness"" was happening a lot before the surgery, which took place a year later. So this sickness is not related to the procedure. 

So I begin to lose weight again and the sickness keeps happening. At first, I don't correlate the sickness to weight loss. I see the Dr's at UCLA and we do a bunch of tests and no one has answers. 

Long story short - I'm an idiot and I start to put weight back on. I go up and down from then till now, gaining back almost all of my original weight. I had been down 100 pounds at my lowest, post-surgery. But as I fluctuate up and down, I start to realize this pattern that the sickness occurs ONLY when I am losing weight. When I am doing well, weight-loss wise, the sickness is occurring 3 or 4 times a week, lasts anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes, and is about as painful as anything I've experienced. Always diarrhea and vomiting at the same time. The good news is that post surgery, my stomach is always empty and it's just dry-heaves. Though I suspect that actually hurts more. 

So I would start to do well in losing weight, but then the pain and misery would be too much and I'd give up. My feeling was, eat a hamburger today and feel great, or eat some chicken and suffer. It's very depressing. 

In my many attempts to lose weight, I tracked the food I was eating. With each new diet, I tried different eliminations, trying to determine what it was that I was taking away or adding that could be the culprit, always assuming it has something to do with food. For example, when I diet I eat more whole grains and bananas and chicken, etc. The last go around all I did was eat less. I did not change a single thing, food-wise, just to see. Sure enough, 5 pound loss and I'm sick. Maybe the only thing I did change on that last one was not drinking caffeinated soda. EVERY single interval between trying to lose weight is sickness-free. I NEVER get sick when I am gaining or staying at the same weight. I was tested for celiac disease, but the test was fine and again, I get sick with the same foods that I was eating when I was gaining weight.

My normal diet is horrific. Fast food, treats, lots and lots and lots of soda (Coke/Dr. Pepper). Sausgae McMuffins are the food incarnate of the devil himself, but I love em. I simply love them. When I diet I eat skinless, boneless chicken a lot. Some fruits. I'm not a vegetables guy. I drink too much milk in any case, but try to limit it when dieting. Also when dieting I do always drink plenty of water. 

So - anyone have any ideas? After the many Dr's and much internet research, I've found no answers. I'd like to start dieting and exercising again, but the thought of all that pain is making me feel down about it. 

Lot's of gold to anyone that helps me find the answer. :)

I work as a boom operator for film/tv, which puts my shoulders in constant use. 

I have been using acupuncture for treatment for about 6-7 months now for burisitus and tendonitis of my right shoulder. 

The tendon in question is my bicep tendon. After about a month of being pain free from laying off the shoulder and recieiving acupuncture treatments I decided to begin light exercises in the form of water aerobics to begin strengthening the shoulder. 

Today is the day after, and the pain has returned in almost full force. 

My question for you guys is about cortisone. My other doctor suggests I get it, but I hear from many sources (non-doctors) that cortisone will only temporarily fix a problem and can in fact weaken my shoulder further. I can't decide if I should take the shot or not, but I do know that what I'm doing naturally is simply not working. Should I take the shot?

Ever since then, my gooch has started to bleed, maybe it's because i'm sitting around all day because there's nothing really else to do and walking hurts, but everytime i go to the bathroom, or even in my boxers just from sitting, there is blood on the toilet seat or in my boxers. I'm really embarrassed to tell my mom or anybody.. because how do you say my gooch is bleeding without feeling embarrassed.

Other details, i'm overweight, I'm sitting down all day nearly every day, except school, and it might be because of too much skin down there so it rubs and creates sores?

How do you say gooch is bleeding without feeling embarassed? You shouldn't feel embarrassed talking to your mom about it. At 14 yo you may feel more self conscious about your body and talking about it, but by the time you are your mom's age, it is just anatomy and science. For one, you could try using more accurate term. You said the cyst is from the lower back/top of your butt (this is also the most common location for a pilonidal cyst); stop using the term gooch as it is inaccurate- this is slang to sometimes describe the perineum which is where your scrotum meets your anus. So instead tell your mom you are bleeding at your intergluteal cleft or natal cleft.
As for your second question, you answered it correctly yourself. Being overweight and having excess skin in that region will continue to cause you problems. Talk to your doctor to see if they can help you plan a weight loss regimen. 
Lastly, don't be discouraged or embarassed. Everything you are describing is much more common than you'd think in your age group and pilonidal cysts tend to recur so you may be dealing with this for a while.

NE Kansas isn't exactly well known to be an area with high prevalence of deer ticks that carry Lyme. When I took my infectious disease rotation for medical school I remember that specifically for Lyme that the tick usually has to have a prolonged duration of attachment (approx 48-72 hrs of feeding) for significant amount of tick salivary exchange in your wound to occur to transfer the parasite. Do you happen to know how long the tick was attached to you? Erythema migrans (the characteristic rash that occurs with Lyme) doesn't occur in everyone, if I remember correctly only 20-40% of people develop this rash. You said you don't have any other symptoms which is a plus. You said the head is stuck and that poses a concern for bacterial infection (especially Staph), but again day 5 pic looks pretty good. I'd say keep an eye on it and if it keeps improving, you have no pain, no fevers, I don't think it would be necessary to see a doc.

When I move my hand over the areas it feels a little rough but that's it. It's almost like having a bunch of goosebumps that don't go away. I asked my doctor about them and she just told me to use some different soap, which didn't work. When I work out they get more red and noticeable, but I think that's just from blood flowing.

Alright, so for the past two years or so I have been having these weird pains in my legs. It is in both legs, but it seems to be most often in my right hip and my left thigh. It only happens at the end of the day or if I've been sitting or laying down for a long time. It's a dull pain, and it's really hard to describe. My hip feels like it is being stretched to far, like it's out of its socket even though I know it's not (that would be excruciating). I always feel like I have to get up and stretch my legs. If I move or switch positions it is temporarily relieved but it always comes back. It is really annoying more than painful, and sometimes I can't sleep because of it.

I asked my doctor and she said it could be some kind of restless leg, but said I should take ibuprofen for a while and see if that clears it up. I did, and nothing happened. Ibuprofen will relieve some of the pain but it never takes it away. 

I am worried about arthritis, like RA or psoriatic arthritis since I did have psoriasis when I was a kid. My mom has bad osteoarthritis in her hip. But her pain is not like mine. Mine never hurts with movement, just with rest. (Actually my hip does tend to hurt when I run.)

Anyone have any idea what this is? I'm at my wits end.

I've had this for over two years now, I think. I was eating triscuits and my guess is that I swallowed a piece that was too large in just the wrong way and that some kind of abcess on my tonsil was punctured, because I gagged and puked, and there was a bit of blood suspended in mucus, but there wasn't any more blood after that. Really mysterious and I constantly wonder about what happened and what it is. Within the next 6 months, approx, i had several rounds of steroids to try to shrink the weird growth thing. It has just stayed there. It gets red and inflamed when I get sick like the rest of my throat but right now there really isn't anything going on. Help me figure out what the fuck this is because last time a doctor looked at it she said that it didn't need to be removed because it wasn't restricting airflow. I doubt I'll get a biopsy on it for the same reason. It's just weird! What do you guys think?

On day two of taking my antibiotics I got what I can only assume was a sinus infection. My whole house had had it, and finally it was my turn. I have continued to take my antibiotics thinking that would also help knock out whatever this is. At night it gets so bad, I lay down and can not sleep because as soon as I try to sleep I cough. I took some nyquil for the first time last night and it didn't do much for me other than help repress the cough. I woke up this morning feeling achy and my body feels like it has been hit by a truck.

This can happen about once every 5 minutes. When I bend my right thumb in towards my palm like I'm holding up four fingers, a shooting tingling sensation goes up from the base of my thumb and through the fleshy part below it into the middle of the heel pad of my hand. The best way I can describe the sensation is that same feeling when you hit your elbow against a surface just the wrong way. It's not painful, just unexpected and uncomfortable.

Moving my hand from a supine position to pronate position while holding an object can also trigger the sensation.

This has been going on for a couple weeks now and only started after I finished mowing my lawn one day.

Any ideas?

Last Spring (over a year ago), I spent quite a bit of time outside without shoes on, and developed a small area (less than a dime) of pain on the big toe mound of my left bottom foot.  I assumed that something, like a splinter, had gotten lodged in there, and that it would fix itself.

It did not get better, but worse.  Sometimes, if I would step wrong or put pressure on it wrong, like when riding a bike, I would feel sharp pain up into my foot.  I assumed that something was really lodged in there, and so went to the doctor to help get it removed.

The doctor told me that I have a wart, and that I need to use DuoFilm.  This was around October 2013.  I used the DuoFilm, and it did not get better.  I went back to the doctor around February, saying ""Hey, I think there's something in my foot.""  Again, they told me, ""You have a wart, it takes a long time to go away in that area.""

So, it's more than a year later, and this thing on my foot has not gotten any better.  Sometimes it doesn't bother me at all, but sometimes if I step wrong, there is a sharp pain into my foot.

I really don't want to go to the doctor again and have them tell me it's a wart, because that DuoFilm does not help.

I called a medic on myself to escort me to first aid and by that point I felt like I was going to faint. He told me I was dehydrated and I told him my daily rountine, but he assured me that I essentially sweated out all the salts out of my body and water could not replenish those. I got sent home, and I hoped that my feeling of blah would go away in a day.

It's now been four days and I still feel the symptoms. Everytime I eat something I'm making constant trips to the bathroom and I haven't had solid stool since the incident.

It the last few months I have been getting sick every few weeks or so. It is usually a cold that lasts a few days. I had some diarrhea a few weeks ago also.

During this period of increased illness I have been experienced heightened stress and anxiety levels.

I have lost my job. I have had insomnia for a while now. I have also been drinking more than usually and have had a poor diet. 

I feel like with all the anxiety/depression my body is just giving up. I have had anxiety issues all my life but for the last few months it has been worse than usual. I have been snacking because it makes me feel a little better.

Also, because I have been sick/tired so much, I have not been able to exercise nearly as much as I used to.

I have taken steps to improve the situation such as taking vitamins and trying to improve my diet. I have also stopped drinking as much. 

The stress and anxiety is still not going away. I have moments when I feel tearful and start getting panic attacks.

I went with over-sanitation; such as people bathing in Purell and that we are destroying our immune systems in order to stay healthy.

I've read a few articles, but I was looking to get some input from some medical professionals. I'd just like to hear some general views toward how anti-bacterials interact with our bodies and the possible relation to the rise in autoimmune disorders. Also how many of the foods we eat are now sterilized as well, and the effect that has on us.

If you don't mind I'll bring up some things that may help you organize it? For one you mentioned some terms: sanitizing and sterilizing which are not the same thing. To not overcomplicate the definition, sanitizing means you are reducing the number of pathogens on your skin (leaving behind an acceptable/allowable amount), whereas sterilizing means absolutely nothing lives. You used it correctly and it's good that you are narrowing it to addressing one or the other. Most medical professionals don't like the use of anti-bacterial soap, but we do sanitize our hands frequently using alcohol based products like Purell. It is interesting to note that we sanitize so often, but do not necessarily have any worse immune system than your average person. If it were true that sanitation is destroying our immune systems then the first people I should see dropping dead would be my surgical colleagues as they do a thorough first of the day scrub with either iodine or chlorhexidine and then multiple times throughout the rest of the day with Triseptin or a similar product. So no I don't think there is such a thing as over-sanitation in an immune-competent individual aka otherwise healthy adult. I would focus your research/project on looking into the effects of oversanitation in infants and children (these are individuals who may or may not have yet developed a mature immune system).

I've been to a Dermatologist, ENT, and allergy doctor. The doctors are pretty good at identifying pre-cancerous conditions I have they can see with their eyes, such as:

Folliculitis - I've had this for over 10 years now. Started out as a couple white bumps on the shaft after shaving. Now there are hundreds of white bumps around the base of the shaft, on the testicles, and more still showing up on the shaft towards the tip. Some of these can be popped.

Eosinophilic Esophagitis - Diagnosed about 7 months ago, had symptoms for about a year and a half, right after a trip to San Francisco. Trouble swallowing, food getting stuck in throat, always need a glass of water nearby while eating to push food down. My sinuses and back of my throat are very very red and inflamed, sticking a tissue up my nose will bring back some blood.

Other health issues:

Chronic red itchy eyes - I've noticed everyone around me has the same condition after I got it. My whole family, old friends, new friends... all of them have it after meeting me. It starts as them feeling like they got something stuck in their eye, it can get inflamed, produces tears, very itchy.

Contact Dermatitis - I got this the first time on a boat about a year ago from having my arms rubbing on a leather seat. The same condition just happened yesterday without any noticeable cause.

Post nasal drip - Dairy seems to exacerbate the condition.

Thick mucus - Sometimes very thick and pale, other times a bit green

Acne - Nose covered in blackheads, acne on chest and back mostly, some on face, neck, arms, legs, ears.

Chest Pain - Happens more frequently and with more pain if I haven't been exercising much.

Itchy nose - This usually lasts about a month then goes away.

White coat on tongue - I brush my tongue vigorously twice daily.

Discolored spot on tongue - This showed up about 3 months ago, slightly darker pink spot near the tip of my tongue on the left side.

I've been prescribed different antibiotics:
Clindamycin Azithromycin Amoxicillin one or two more

After taking these there has never been any change.

I've tried to just avoid contact with people, not meet new people for the last 4 years. I've started meeting new people and now they are having some of the same symptoms as I have. I've tried describing this situation to my doctors but they don't seem able to help or give advice.

I've been tested for STDs multiple times and I'm always clean. I've had just one sexual partner and that seems like it'll stay that way for a while.

How can I get my doctors to take my health seriously?

What questions do I need to ask?

What doctor should I try to see next, ophthalmologist or infectious disease specialist?

Should I still be meeting new people or should I stay home until this is figured out?

6 surgeries since Dec 2005.  First was pinning and second was removing pins and wires.  3rd was a fusion in May 2006 when the pinning proved unsuccessful.  4th was to put my big toe back on the ground after it had been displaced by the fusion.   5th put a plate and 4 screws in the metatarsal leading to my big toe b/c it kept breaking.   6th was to remove that plate and screws when the front screw backed itself out.

Steroids will absolutely mess with your mood and have other cognitive effects. In general, though not always, they will act like an amplifier on your pre-existing cognitive state. The feet warm thing is just sort of a random effect - it will change blood flow and vessel tone and in some people they just happen to notice it more in one spot than another. Basically new sensations and your brain is trying to parse it together into something it already knows and can describe. 

The dizziness could be any number of things. The most alarming one would be changes in your electrolyte balance and kidney function along with direct effects that make it difficult to control your blood pressure leading to what we call ""orthostatic hypotension"" - basically your body can't respond quite right to the blood rushing out of your head as you stand or otherwise change position. 

Do *not* mess around with this without your doctor. Stopping cold after &lt;2 weeks of use is now considered completely safe (e.g. the ""taper down"" method is old school and doesn't hurt, but isn't needed). But that is only for otherwise naive patients. The longer you are on it - even at small doses - the more dangerous suddenly stopping can be. Even to the point of rendering you incapacitated and semi- or fully comatose (in extreme cases). Point being, if you suddenly ran out and couldn't get a refill after self experimentation you could be in a lot of trouble. 

Random tidbit of medical trivia and history - in the WWII days it was discovered that cortisol had amazingly powerful effects on the body. It was noted that it basically amped you up, made you feel great, etc etc. The US gov't wanted to develop it as something like a ""super soldier"" drug to complement and replace a lot of the amphetamine they had been giving soldiers (also true story, amphetamine was taken pretty much daily and in high doses to keep soldiers going in wartime). In fact, they were convinced that the Germans had already succeeded in doing this, which was actually incorrect. This led the US gov't to contract Merck to develop a synthetic cortisol. They poured every resource of the company into it, basically banking on it making them fabulously rich because it was a wonder drug. They succeeded in the synthesis but only after the war ended. Then it was realized how many horrible side effects there were and that it could never be used as intended, which completely bankrupted Merck. They were forced to merge with Sharpe and Dohme, Inc. a chemical manufacturing company. That was the only thing that saved them from going completely under.

If you don't wanna read my angsty ramblings about my symptoms, just skip to the bottom :)

First, let explain my situation:

I'm 21, white, female, 5'9"", 140 lbs, from the US. It's probably worth it to mention that I'm usually an extremely healthy individual--I take very good care of my body, eat plenty of fresh/healthy foods, and exercise regularly. A year and a half ago (give or take a few months), I started having these awful symptoms. My digestion was completely irregular, I got *extremely* bloated, my hair was falling out in patches, I had brain fog/mood swings all the time, my hormones were all out of whack...the list goes on and on. The longer these things went on, the more I realized there was something wrong with me. A year ago, I went to the doctor, described my symptoms, got a ""you're just stressed"" diagnosis. They did some tests anyways (autoimmune things like Hashimotos, Graves, Celiac's, etc.), but they all came back negative. I was told that my iron levels were low (which didn't really make sense to me based on my non-vegetarian, leafy-green-heavy diet...but I'm no trained professional so I  honestly have no idea) and that my thyroid production was lower than average, so I was given supplements for both. 

A few months later, things were still getting gradually worse. I'd been doing a lot of research on dietary changes that may help these problems, so I started playing around with my diet since that was a pretty safe way of ""self treating"" without actually self-treating, if that makes any sense. I went gluten-free in October--saw little to no change. Tried to cut down on my (already way lower than the average American's...don't get me started) sugar intake, even limiting fruit and grains. That seemed to help a little, but not a ton. By the time I went to the doctor again in January, and I had noticed a few more symptoms (I bruise really easily, am very sensitive to chemical smells to the point where I get very nauseous/lightheaded, I'm always fatigued, etc.), but still got a noncommittal ""this is just a phase your body is going through"" diagnosis with a prescription for ""do more yoga"" and ""try to be less stressed"". Right. I tried limiting FODMAPs, increasing my whole grain intake, cutting out grains completely, going raw, vegetarianism, pescatarianism, you name it, I've probably tried it.

At this point, I've completely cut out grains and dairy (except for kefir). I consume lots of probiotics and fermented foods, tons of vegetables. and usually 2-4 servings of fruit per day. I'm pretty sure I have gut permeability/leaky gut, although I'm not sure if this is a cause or a symptom, and I've been trying to adjust my diet/lifestyle accordingly. I'm doing better at managing this whole thing myself...I just wish I had some sort of answers/support/*anything* really from a medical professional, you know? But either way, I'm improving! Slowly but surely.

ANYWAYS, enough about me. Back to my main question: **why is this so common?** I've talked to a bunch of people about this whole thing and a surprising amount of people relate. A recurring theme seems to be that a lot of women experience some sort of gastrointestinal unpleasantness in their early 20s. I have a good friend who has the exact same symptoms I do and has gotten the same response from doctors. I have some friends a few years older than I am that are still on restrictive diets because of this happening to them a few years prior. I even have friends of my parents (20+ years older than I am) that experienced similar symptoms at my age. It just got me thinking: if this is actually a trend and not just a coincidence, what on earth could be causing all of this? Surely this can't just be a ""something that every woman goes through"" kind of thing...right? I figured if anyone had any answers, they'd probably be on reddit :)

**TL;DR**: I have all sorts of leaky gut symptoms but no official diagnosis. I know a fair number of other people (all women, my age group) in the same boat. Coincidence?

I have a problem for 2 months now and I wonder if you guys had any ideas of what it could be. 
First of all, I'm 23, 70Kg/1,77m (I'm french average), no heart disease background and I don't take any kind of drugs/medication, no self-medication either. I've smoked for a few years but have stopped a year ago, and have never smoked since.

For a few months now, I've had trouble breathing. At first, it was just like I needed to yawn to take my breath (but couldn't) a few times a day, but now it's everyday, almost every time. It doesn't wake me at night, but it give me some trouble to sleep. No position makes it easier to breath : standing or lying in bed is the same for me.

When I was a child, I've had those kind of issues, but it was only before sleep, where I'd try to catch my breath, and had to sit for a couple of minutes once in a while.

No stressful event happened recently, but I am a bit more stressed than usual (exam period and all), but I don't think it can be related, tho it might aggravate my situation.

It's becoming really hard to live with this as it makes me sleepy all day, and I can really feel I lack oxygen. This situation is a real vicious circle because the more I think of it, the more I'm stressed about it, and the more I have a bad time trying to breath, suffocating.

If any of you had an idea? I'm trying to have an appointment asap with my doctor

Thanks to all of you

She told me that it would start with a weird, ominous feeling, and then she would hear a specific combo of three musical notes (I don't know what they are, she couldn't describe it very well) but she made it sound like it was some sort of auditory hallucination that was the same sound each time. When she heard it, she would suddenly feel very afraid, like something bad was going to happen or someone was going to hurt her, and couldn't be consoled. This apparently got so bad that she couldn't sleep at night. She said her parents took her to a doctor (I think it was a child psychiatrist but I'm not sure) and she just remembers him telling her that when she's scared she should just think ""My mom and dad are here and nothing bad can happen."" In fact she used to tell me that when I was little :). As she got older, the episodes gradually went away, but she says that sometimes even now she'll hear that combination of notes in songs or what have you and it's sort of jarring. 

I was very intrigued by this and just wondered if this was some kind of anxiety disorder or seizure or something. She is perfectly healthy now, no mental health issues or anything, the only thing I can even think of that is a health issue is that she has an irregular heartbeat. There is no mental illness/neurological problems in her family, or in me or my sister. Any ideas are welcome!

EDIT: I felt like I should add that I can't think of any significant trauma in her childhood that would have led to mental health problems; she lived in a happy family with two parents who loved each other and a little brother, and lots of friends.

Many things that are nothing and something start out exactly the same way and are completely undifferentiable. Playing the odds, the best thing to do is reassure you that it is almost certainly nothing serious, knowing you will come back if it does become one of the rare more serious things and knowing that we couldn't have diagnosed or done anything about it sooner regardless.

 A few months ago, i began getting these really severe headaches. I normally do not get headaches or migraines and these just seem off to me. They are very sharp, come completely randomly and last only seconds. Sometimes there is a faint ache for a few minutes afterwards. I have dropped things before because it is so sudden and painful. 

Anywho, i felt that it was strange so i went to my doctor, who didnt seem to concerned with it, but ordered a CT scan anyways because she said it was pretty simple and covered by my insurance completely. 
Today the results said that there was a 9mm , what they think is, meningioma. She told me that it is a benign tumor and not a big deal because it was so small and wasnt causing symptoms.  She ordered an MRI to confirm that that is indeed a meningioma tumor. 

I understand that it is tiny, but i guess i am a bit confused as to why she doesnt feel like the headaches are serious symptoms. Is this something that would be discussed with me more in detail by the specialist when i go to get the MRI? Is it just assumed that its not going to need to be removed because it is so small? She said to monitor it, what if it gets a tiny bit bigger? then does it need to get removed?

That said, in general terms, a meningioma is a *100% completely benign* tumor of the lining of the brain or spinal cord. It is absolutely nothing to worry about in terms of it being a ""cancer."" It will not spread, it will not invade tissue, and you will not need chemotherapy for it. The only damage they can do is by physically compressing parts of the brain or spinal cord. 

It is indeed quite possible that a meningioma can compress a small part of the brain and cause headache. It sounds like it is not based on the fact that your doctor is not referring you to a neurosurgeon to have it removed. The only way one can know is by looking at the scan and seeing where it is. In this case we would refer to it as an [incidentaloma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidentaloma) meaning that it was found because of your symptoms but isn't actually causing your symptoms. In that case it is absolutely appropriate to watch and wait. Some meningiomas don't grow or are so slow growing they don't cause problems for years. And nobody wants brain surgery (even something as easy and straightforward as a meningioma resection) for funsies. It will only need to be removed if it actually starts pushing up on your brain. And don't worry. It can totally push up on the brain without causing serious or permanent damage. 

If you are still concerned it is perfectly reasonable to ask your doctor to go over the scan with you and show you exactly where the meningioma is relative to your brain and have him explain what would need to happen in order for them to advise you to get surgery to remove it. It is not an emergency, so schedule it at the convenience of your physician. If (s)he refuses, find another physician. I will *always* go over scans with my patients, *especially* if they request it. 

The rest of what /u/neuropharm115 said is spot on. Headaches can be multifarious. Keep a log of when they happen, how long they last, as detailed a description of them as you can (location: behind the eyes, in the back of the head, stationary, moving, unilateral, bilateral, etc quality: throbbing, dull, sharp, brings tears to your eyes, searing, stabbing, sudden onset, gradual, etc triggers: whatever you did, ate, drank up to 60 minutes before onset other: auras, flavors in your mouth, time of day, *time of month*, other sensations you experience during it like tingling arms, legs, mouth, etc what makes it better or worse)

As for why the headaches themselves aren't serious symptoms - because they are extremely common and you are an otherwise healthy young woman. There are a few red flags we look for and it seems you don't have any of them. Even I could tell that because if you did you wouldn't be writing this right now. It may be something more serious or sinister than just random ass headaches that people get, but it isn't anything that will kill you (or else you'd be dead or in the ICU right now, hence my comment about not being able to Reddit). It could be new onset of migraines. It could be strange seizure activity. It could be menstrual headaches. Or sex headaches. Or cluster headaches. Or trigeminal neuralgia. And on and on and on. But we don't have an objective diagnostic to determine that. Scans and blood tests won't help. So we need you to give us all the pieces over time and then we put it together. Typically that means years of this and going back many times until finally a doctor puts the jigsaw puzzle together. But you can make that a lot shorter by keeping a really accurate (and objective as possible) diary of it. That way we have more pieces sooner and more reliably. It may come down to just lifestyle modifications to help (my uncle, for example cannot drink red wine because it gives him splitting migraines; that started in his late 30's) or there are neurological medications to take for certain kinds of headaches (they aren't perfect and don't always work, but they do help a lot of people) or specific medicine for migraine if that is what it seems to be. 

Anyways, try not to worry too much about it. There is actually a very good chance that before you even have time to get a good diary together all of this will have passed and nobody will have any idea what the hell was going on in the first place. Such is life. 

In the meantime, you've got a few things to do and work on and really nothing to worry about the meningioma. If you have more questions, I'll be happy to answer them as best I can.",t3_2762v8,6.0,AskDocs,nybgrus,chxzcx6,1401797954,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2762v8

Usually happens if I try to flex my legs while I'm sleeping, and it happens so much now that I automatically roll out of bed and stand up as soon as I feel one coming on. Nothing seems to help - potassium, magnesium, hydration, etc. I'm starting to wonder if the muscle problems I'm having in my legs aren't related to the same things that cause my foot cramps.

So yeah. What kind of doctor should I see about this? My GP has no idea what could be wrong. And for the record, this has been going on long before I was overweight. Being overweight definitely hasn't helped, but even when I was a skinny kid I had these problems.

UK based. Normally a cold for me is just sniffles or a sore throat for a few days, but I've had strong cold symptoms for over two weeks and they got quite uncomfortable over the weekend so I went to see a GP yesterday. Before I'd even finished talking I was prescribed a 7 day course of Amoxicillin (21 x 500mg) and was not allowed to ask about anything else! No diagnosis given.

I went and paid for the prescription, came home and popped one of the capsules before thinking the GP didn't seem to have done anything to determine it was a bacterial infection. So I called 111 and was told by a doctor that my symptoms do indeed sound viral, and was surprised the GP hadn't listened to my chest. She told me I should be OK to ignore the antibiotics for now, and just keep them in case I do end up needing them.

EXAMINATION PERFORMED

CERVICAL SPINE 4-5 VIEWS

CLINICAL HISTORY

martial arts injury with recurrent symptoms in left arm x 8 weeks ago, pain exclusively in left arm making  first 3 digits numb per patient.

COMPARISON

NONE.

TECHNIQUE

Cervical spine AP lateral and oblique views

FINDINGS

On lateral view C1 through T1 are well visualized.  There is straightening and reversal of the normal  cervical lordotic curvature with the apex the curve reversal at C4-5.  No prevertebral soft tissue swelling  is observed in the cervical vertebra and disc spaces are normal in height.

On oblique views, the facets appear normally aligned. No jumped or perched facet is observed. Hypertrophic  marginal spurring is noted resulting in mild to moderate bilateral C5-6 foraminal stenosis. . The remainder  the neural foramen are adequately maintained.  There are no cervical ribs.

IMPRESSION

Mild to moderate bilateral C5-6 foraminal narrowing due to uncovertebral joint spurring.  Reversal the normal  cervical lordotic curvature.",[deleted],,,,0,,,False,t3_277qw2,True,False,,,1401818202.0,False,verified-doc,,0.0,t1_chyd4ha,Physician,1434080033.0,True,False,5,0,0,t5_2xtuc,t3_277qw2,False,"Whatever you do, do not listen to chiropractors. They have the tiniest sliver of evidence to support some of the lower back stuff they do, but beyond that are utter quacks.

For a direct translation:

Looking sideways (from shoulder to shoulder) all of the cervical vertebrae and the first thoracic vertebra are seen well enough to read. The is straightening of the normal forward (lordotic) curve, making it less curved forward, with the flattest part right in the center at C4-C5. There is no evidence of soft tissue swelling or damage and the discs between the vertebrae (the disc of ""slipping a disc"") are normal height, which indicates that they are unlikely to be compressed or herniated. 

Looking at angles, you can see the facets which are the way that the vertebrae form joints between each other. These are normal and in good alignment. There is no evidence of a broken facet (jumping/perching). There is some overgrowth (hypertrophic) of the bone around the holes between the vertebrae where the nerves exit at the C5-6 holes (foramina). This makes them narrow (stenosis). All the rest of the holes (foramina) look normal. There are no extra ribs (which are an uncommon but possible cause of nerve compression).

IMPRESSION:

Mild to moderate narrowing of the holes where the nerves at C5-6 exit due to bone spurs forming at the lip of the bone edges forming the holes between the two vertebrae (uncovertebral joint). Reversal of the normal forward curve of the neck.

=========

What does this all mean? Tough to say given such limited information and limited imaging (unless you are a quack and then you can come up with anything). 

What is clear is that there is no serious trauma or damage. /u/imnotwillferrell was spot on in his (her?) assessment. The evidence *clearly* shows that the most common cause of loss of lordotic curvature is spasm. The tingling your husband notes in the 1st three digits corresponds to the ulnar nerve distribution. The ulnar nerve is derived from the nerve roots of C8 and T1 and sometimes C7. This does not correspond with the noted foraminal narrowing in the xray. 

Most commonly stenosis like this does *not* cause symptoms, but it certainly can if it gets bad enough or just happens to be in a bad spot. Since the radiographic findings don't correlate with the clinical exam listed, it is probably incidental. The best thing to do would be to give it some time to heal and recover, take a rest to let the muscles spasming relax, but then get back to normal movement and activity sooner rather than later. Given a week or two everything should be back to normal. If it does not get normal, gets worse, or the nature of the numbness and tingling change or worsen that would be an indication for further follow up and imaging. None of it is an emergency and unless things don't improve there is absolutely no reason for further imaging. 

Since it seems that this has been going on for some time, it may require some manual therapy (from a licensed physical therapist) and/or perhaps just a return to normal activity (if that hasn't been the case already). Because we use our neck muscles all the time no matter what it can be difficult to let those areas heal. Muscle spasms can be a vicious spiral and babying it too much can also delay healing and even worsen the condition. The key is to try and get back to normal activity, even with some discomfort (but don't push past real pain). The tingling in the hand could be from the spasms themselves, which is more likely than a bony structure issue.

Of course, only a real examination by a real physician (preferably an orthopedist) can really figure it out and rule out serious issues. 

But whatever you do, please do *not* let a chiro crack his neck. There is *absolutely no evidence* to support *any* neck adjustments for *any* indication, some evidence against it, and evidence to indicate that it can lead to vertebral artery dissection and stroke (it can literally tear one of the arteries going to your brain causing a stroke, though generally chiros will vehemently deny this even though the evidence is clear).",t3_277qw2,5.0,AskDocs,nybgrus,chyd4ha,1401829118,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,277qw2

Mid-20s, male. I try to sleep around 8-9 hours per night, but when (if) I wake up, without exception, I feel so drained that I normally end up falling asleep again. Even if I don't, I remain feeling drained for the whole day, and often fall asleep later on in the day for a few hours. This has happened for as long as I can remember it, and I can't find a pattern or particular length of sleep that makes me feel refreshed at any point during the day - I don't remember the last time that happened. The level of tiredness ebbs and flows; at the moment I am too tired to really do *anything*, whereas sometimes I will just feel minorly sleepy throughout the day but a coffee or two will see me through.

Iron levels are fine. Past history of depression, which definitely contributed while it was around, but currently unmedicated and feeling fine depression-wise. My general diet is fine (provided I don't sleep through a mealtime, but I do my best to catch up sensibly). My general stress levels are pretty low. I drink caffeine only during the first half of my day. I try desperately to keep to a normal sleep pattern, but fail miserably every time.

At my worst, I can easily sleep 14-18 hours. I once slept through a fire alarm. I very frequently walk across my room to (presumably) turn off my alarm clocks several times during the morning, (presumably) stumble back to bed, and have no recollection of this when I wake up again.

When I was in college (20 yrs old) I began experiencing urinary frequency and urgency, at all hours even during the night.  I went to my school's health center and they always said it was a UTI, and that I needed to take an antibiotic, drink cranberry juice, etc.  As the episodes became more and more frequent, I stopped going to the health center and just treated them myself, since they always told me the same thing.  

When I was 21, I got shingles.  The rash wash on the right side of my lower abdomen, and I had some swelling on the right side of my lower pelvis.  The pain was terrible, but I was lucky and the virus passed rather quickly.  Flash forward to this past year, the urinary frequency and urgency became unbearable.  I also had some pain on the right side of my abdomen.  I decided to go to a urologynecologist, and she discovered that I had a large (10 cm) dermoid cyst on my right ovary last July.  She removed it, but I still had urinary frequency and urgency, so she diagnosed me with interstitial cystitis (August/September).  I also still had some pain in the right side of my abdomen, but this was presumed to be due to the surgery.  To treat the urinary symptoms she prescribed 25mg of Elavil.  It made me feel terrible.  I had no motivation.  I felt like I never woke up.  I felt depressed.  But my symptoms were going away.  She also recommended trying acupuncture.  I tried acupuncture once a week for about 4-5 months.  My acupuncturist, always commented on the right side of my abdomen saying that something seemed to be off.  A few months in I stopped feeling pain and it turned into more of an itchy sensation.  I cut my Elavil dosage in half to 12.5 mg and stopped seeing my acupuncturist (to save money).  12.5 mg of Elavil still makes me feel like a zombie, but a little less so.  My urinary frequency and urgency subsided and I was able to sleep through the night.  

Recently, I cut back my Elavil dosage to 5mg.  I will be starting a new job and I need to be mentally alert, as my job will be placing me in potentially dangerous situations.  After a few days I noticed the pain in the right side of my abdomen creeping back up again.  

Now here's my question, and I'm aware I sound like one of those crazy people that spends too much time on WebMD: could my pain be related to PHN instead of IC?  Whenever I feel pain it's on the right side of my abdomen, where my shingles rash was 3 years ago. It's my understanding that the bladder is located in the center of the abdomen, so I'm guessing that the pain is not actually IC related. It's been about 9 months since the dermoid cyst was removed from my right ovary.  I can't imagine that the pain is related to that.  I also understand that tricyclics such as Elavil are used to treat PHN.  Could it be that the Elavil has been masking shingles/PHN related pain?  I see a Nurse Practitioner as my PCP, and a urogynecologist.  Both know that I have a history of shingles, but have made no mention of it being possible related to the pain I have today.  I'd really like to not take Elavil.  Should I make an appointment to see my uro?  Or should I just make an appointment with a pain specialist?  I have health insurance but it will expire at the end of July.  I will have benefits after a probationary period with my new job so I'll have health insurance again in September/October.  Since there will be a lapse in my coverage I am trying to expedite things.  I'd like to make an appointment with someone who will help me now, rather than refer me to another specialist in a few months. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!

It is great that you want to change your lifestyle. 
Start by informing yourself. Check out /r/fitness for advice on excersize. I strongly advice to get a sort of fit-test at a local gym and have them put a beginners regimen together for you. Once you are on your way, you can probably do it on your own. Beginning athletes tend to get injured because they want too much too soon with poor technique. 

About the food: common sense and /r/nutrition . You don't have to go full healthfreak, but you know what is unhealthy. Basically it's anything you can eat out of a bag without doing anything to it apart from warming it up in the microwave or oven. Check out the internet and find recipies that look easy and healthy. 
I'm from the Netherlands and here it is very common to have breakfast with a few slices of bread with something like cheese or nutella or jam or whatever and something to drink. As a snack you can eat fruit. Then for lunch we sort of repeat with again sandwiches and drinks. It is no drama if you eat a cookie in the afternoon or evening, as long as you don't empty the entire bag. For dinner you need to start preparing your own foods. This can be as easy as spaghetti with fresh vegetables or just plain old meat-veggies-potatoes (the last two cooked, not baked ;)). Takes maybe 15 minutes to prepare so it's really not that big of a deal. A bag of crisps on the weekend: fine! Just not every day. It is easier to stick to a new health regimen if you make it easy to follow, so not too strict. 

Last: change takes time. So don't be disappointed if you screw up. If you stay at home for a day because you are tired. Just start over the next day. You can start over every single day because every day you can choose if you want to be good to your body.

First I tried the mini pill and a couple brands of the combo pill that didn't work out. My doctor always tells me to skip the sugar placebo pills so I don't bleed at all, since I get awful PMDD symptoms. Before I started the pill the bleeding itself was very light, I just couldn't deal with the mental and physical side effects of the hormone changes during the cycle. 

Anyway, now I am on Beyaz and have been for about 7 months. For the first 5 months everything was fine, no bleeding at all since I was skipping the placebo, except December when I had a few days of bleeding and that was it. No other side effects at all. 

But now I have been bleeding since the beginning of April till now (beginning of June) every single day. I also get pain under my abdomen where my uterus would be. It comes and goes but its a mix of slightly sharp, moderate throbbing and sort of what a menstrual cramp would feel like. Finally I get bloating in that small area, quite a bit at a time but it usually only lasts for a few hours and if I take a nap or wait long enough it goes away and it becomes completely flat again. 

The bleeding is red, pink, brown, light brown, and sometimes a little bit of purple there too. It isn't continuous per se, its more like a little bit comes out then nothing for awhile and then more comes out. If I pee or poo even more comes out at once. And even more comes out during sex, but the sex is NOT painful. But tampons are extremely painful with sharp and stinging pains even when I put them in the correct way and the way that I wouldn't have even felt it before hand. It continues to be painful a few minutes after its in. But a much bigger penis doesn't hurt at all. 

Not that it isn't a complaint but since this started sex has been even better than it was before (already super good in the last 2 years with him). It's almost like I'm much more sensitive inside the vagina and not in the front part. Like I would usually orgasm from penetration eventually since we like to go closer to 30 min, but it would only happen if he was on top. Now it takes closer to 10 min (sometimes less) and doesn't matter if I'm on top or he is. I can also feel him much more strongly in the back of the vagina. Again, not a complaint, but not sure if sensitivity has changed and if so that would be relevant.

Finally the amount of blood I get has been increasing. There's just more of it each time. For example during sex, my boyfriend's penis used to get a couple streaks of it, but now, even with no pain his penis was covered in it and it even filled up the space between the head and the foreskin. The amount of bleeding the rest of the time is greater too. 

I have not missed any birth control pills and have taken it at the exact time (within 10 minutes) every day except maybe once when I was only about 20 to 25 minutes late. They haven't caused any other issues that I know of. I am NOT pregnant nor have I ever been. My last gynecologist exam in November/early december was normal except for a yeast infection so minor I didn't have any symptoms and apparently cleared up within a few days. I don't have any history of gynecological problems like PCOS or with sex--never pain, never any diseases or infections from sex. So I don't know what the issue could be. I only have partner and he only has me as a partner.

I don't drink or smoke and eat as healthily as I can.

Despite this, I somehow have sleep apnea (AHI of 18.5 at the last sleep study I did a few weeks ago). Because of the terrible fatigue I've battled with the past few years, I've developed panic disorder and depression on top of everything else.

I'm being tortured and all I want to do is feel better, but the doctors I've encountered over the past 5 years have done everything they could to undermine my confidence in medical professionals. The image wasn't clear at first, but I've been to a lot of appointments with a lot of different doctors, and patterns have started to emerge. I list a few below with some anecdotes.

- They all seem very hand-wavy. I had heart issues as a kid, and I recently went back to my cardiologist with concerns about my heart feeling weak among other things. He barely looked at me, said I was too young to have problems, and sent me on my way. My sleep doctor was sure that my apneas were obstructive rather than central, even though after 4 sleep studies, the vast majority of my events have been clear-airway events.

- Most of the time, the doctors are at a total loss unless I nudge them in one direction or another - e.g. my recent headaches totally baffled my GP until I recommended that it was one of the drugs I was using to sleep exacerbating my apnea (all details he knew already), causing my jaw to clench during sleep. I started sleeping with a mouthpiece and it got a lot better.

- Not all, but some seem particularly money-grubbing. I asked one of my doctors if they could fill out a short medical cert form for my work without an appointment - I live very close to them, and have paid them a LOT of money over the last few months, so I would have liked this small favor. Refused, saying I wasn't one of his patients because I didn't have a pending appointment.


Look, I don't know what to say. I have a lot of experience with doctors and I simply feel unsafe, un-cared-for and very wary being in their hands. I understand that it is a difficult profession and that medicine is only so well understood, but it seems like the number of you who treat it as a simple job as opposed to a profoundly important one is scaring the shit out of me. I'm afraid I'll never get better, and that doesn't leave me a lot of options.

I'm not sure what the objective of your post is, but let me share some thoughts:

* We get trained to think horses, not zebras; consider (rare presentations of) more common diseases before rare diseases. Central apnea is rarer than obstructive apnea, for example.
* GPs have a though job: it is nearly impossible to have a sufficient, general knowledge of the whole of medicine, and it gets harder everyday. GP's should be able to see when their expertise ends and a referral would be in order.
* Don't see the fact that you can point a doctor in the right direction as something negative. You seem like an expert on your own disease, use that expertise and participate in your own healthcare decisions.
* Doctors - as all human beings - don't like failure. We all know the 'heart sink feeling' when we see the name of the patient with persistent, largely subjective symptoms, with an complex interplay of physical, psychological and social factors who we don't seem to be able to help. Not all doctors cope with that feeling equally well.
* I can't comment on the financial part: as a physician who practises in an European country with universal healthcare, we don't bill our patients.

--a loss of coordination to some extent--my feet will hit the ground before I expect them to, sending me flying, and I trip and fall at least a few times a day

On the other hand, I've heard people say you should ""sweat out"" infections, and there are many illnesses which thrive right around the 98.6F temperature but don't do so well at significantly higher or lower temperatures.

* I do not smoke, drink alcohol, or do non-prescribed drugs of any kind at all.

* Caffeine, I usually drink one to two sodas a day, this is largely a self-treatment issue I will get to.

* I am unmarried with no kids and live alone.

* I work from home, but try to get out and do things when I can.

* I have an active social life, girlfriend, friends, family, and so I don't sit around playing video games all day or anything.

* My eating habits, while certainly that of a bachelor, are not out of hand.  Two meals a day on average, oftentimes fast food but I generally eat pretty plain and try to make an effort to eat well when I can.  If I snack at home it's usually cereal, pretzels, or fruit.

* I donate blood at local drives every 3 months or so (they hold the drives far enough apart that the same people can always donate) and have for years.

*Current Medications*

* Prilosec (Omeprazole), 20 MG, once daily before eating

* Amitriptyline HCL, 25 MG, once daily before bed 

**Medical History:**

*Long-term issues*

* I've always been kind of shaky/jittery.  Not dramatically, I might just be a shaky person and that's what it's always been chalked up to.

* Sometimes, rarely, when I'm hungry I'll feel very weak.

* Around puberty, around 2001, before I began masturbating really but was having wet dreams, there would be blood in my semen (a test confirmed it was blood).  Did blood work and seemingly nothing ever came of it (I was too young to be 'in charge' of doing this all myself).  As I began masturbating regularly, this issue seemingly went away, though an extended period of time without masturbating would sometimes be painful.  This seems to have gone away.

* Also, around this time if I were to jump and land hard, my prostate area would feel ""jarred"" and would hurt.  Sometimes when I clinch those muscles down there (to pinch off stool, for example) a mild sharp pain will run through it.  Sometimes my left testicle would hurt for no apparent reason.  This still happens with less frequency.

* Starting in mid-late high school I would have very loose stool or diarrhea in the mornings, and when I got particularly nervous.  I still sometimes get diarrhea when I'm nervous and I seem to be sensitive to spicy or certain kinds of foods.  This still continues a little bit.

* Sometimes when I'm gassy I feel a pain in my lower left intestinal area, right next to my hipbone.  Pushing on it often helps me in passing gas.

* For many years I've been prone to headaches - usually nothing terrible that an Ibuprofen or Tylenol wouldn't fix.  Some are worse than others and usually, though not exclusively, gravitate around my left temple.


*Last Couple Years*

* Early 2012; at a regular eye exam I asked my eye doctor about visual auras I'd been seeing for many years.  He explained probably ocular migraines, which explained the headaches.  No medicine prescribed for this.

* In late May of 2012 I experienced a painful tightness in my chest which the doctor diagnosed as Acid Reflux and he put me on a week of Prilosec.  I'd been experiencing a pain in the lower, left side of my ribcage around this time.  I avoided spicy or acidy foods and eventually it calmed down.

* In August of 2012 I came down with mono.  I was also found to have pneumonia and strep throat at this time.  The strep I question because I've read about ""carriers"" and I had no strep-like symptoms that couldn't be blamed on the mono.  The pneumonia was also apparently not bad enough to worry much about.  I was prescribed an antibiotic for the pneumonia and otherwise dealt with the mono which took a few months to feel healthy again from, although I seemed to have less energy even then.

* December 2012, 1 of 2, my stool regularly was very loose (not diarrhea, though sometimes) and a yellow-orange tint and I had the urge to go at least a couple times a day.  This has not gone away.

* December 2012, 2 of 2, I approached my family practitioner about the aforementioned prostate/testicle issues that continued to bother me.  He suggested caffeine was the issue.  I tried to give up on caffeine and did well mostly but then Christmas came and with family gatherings it was almost impossible to avoid caffeine, but now my tolerance was low and I found myself having to urinate a lot, in relatively small amounts (at home I'd pee in a water bottle to measure).  I decided to build my tolerance back up and have since drank 1 to 2 sodas a day and the frequent urination problem seems to have gone away.

* August 2013, saw a GI specialist about the 'yellow stool' problems.  He prescribed me an OTC probiotic which didn't seem to do anything.  He also ordered a few lab tests that all came back fine (CBC, CMP, CRP, TTG, TSH, stool WBC... I've had others and never shown any problems on anything).  Since no one seemed concerned about my stool problems, I just let the issue rest since there were no other problems.

* November, 2013, I threw up on the way home from a nice day out with my girlfriend after experiencing a sharp left-temple ""migraine"" (my diagnosis) which I dulled with an ibuprofen.  I felt totally fine after puking and have no idea what caused it (but I'll never be able to stomach sauerkraut again).

* April, 2014: After about a week of waking up with headaches and taking ibuprofen, I began feeling very acidy in my stomach and throat, like a had a mushy rock in my upper stomach (I realize this is very-likely the result of the ibuprofen; d'oh!).  This at first seemed to come out of no where, but as it went on for a week it seemed to manifest psychologically, like when I was out with friends or somewhere where I was afraid I'd have to puke (car, comic convention, etc).  At home, usually (but not always), I'd be fine, but out and about I'd get queasy regardless of whether I had eaten something earlier.

* April, 2014, con't.  I saw my FP about this and he suggested it was the ibuprofen that set me off, prescribed Prilosec (20 MG) for a week.  Hard to say if symptoms got better during that time, but after I was off for a few days I was still having my nausea issues.  He prescribed me Prilosec for a month and set me back up with the GI specialist for early June in case the issue didn't go away.

* May 27th, 2014 - woke up feeling still a little drowsy and lightheaded but nothing major.  Felt well enough to donate blood that day.  Since then, though, I've been very tired during the day and lightheaded/dizzy.  Not severely (where I feel I'm a danger driving or anything) but it's annoying and unceasing.  Also during this time a very mild runny nose.  Enough to give me gunk to spit up in the morning but not much.

* June 5th, 2014 - a month of Prilosec (20 MG), issue has not completely gone away.  Met with GI specialist who suggested it's IBS and prescribed me Amitriptyline (25 MG).  Said drowsiness and dizziness were likely not related.  Had me give blood for H. Pylori test, no results yet.  I do agree that nerves/stress are having some effect but I'm still not sure what the cause has been. 

* June 6th, 2014 - before taking Amitriptyline I wanted to consult my Dr. about the drowsiness/dizziness so he wouldn't think it a side-effect.  He suggested I just take the Ami., did a blood count and everything was normal.

So that's where I am now.  Thank you for reading all of this.  I'm scared about what could be wrong with me and while I believe my doctors are wise and know what they're doing, I also fear that they're just playing a guessing game which costs me a $20 - $40 copay for every guess (thank God for insurance though!) and I'm tired of this being dragged out for so long with no real resolution.  I'm young and I'm looking forward to summer but as it stands right now I feel like I can barely leave the house without fear of feeling like I'm going to have to puke or use the bathroom suddenly, and now I'm tired and dizzy and that's BEFORE taking the Amitriptyline which I've read can cause those things as a side-effect.  Any advice will be soooo appreciated and I'll answer any questions asap.

Thank you!!!!

Her case seems, to me as a layman, to have been severely worsened by her physicians. The hospital is ranked bottom 10 in Consumer Reports 2014 safety survey.

**My Story**

Grandma (78, in apparent good health previously, walked a mile a day) goes in for pain from constipation, ~four weeks ago. Doctors do colonoscopy and find tumors. Constipation is put on hold as tumors are investigated. Eventually reveals metastasized tumors in bowels, lungs and liver. Nothing is done about bowel and she is sent home.

Doctors explain outlook is very bleak, but allow chemo a try. Ask to put in a port to aid the administration. We're told port is a minor surgery, with no dangerous complications to be worried about should something happen. 

Doctor punctures her lung, does not realize. Fails to insert port and sends her home. 3 days later, she goes to ER, still from the constipation pain but now also from massive shoulder pain. ER doctor says her lung has been punctured from the attempt to put in the port, need to put tube in chest immediately. No anastesiologist available, so chest is penetrated without pain killer. Doctor puts his finger into the hole in her chest during the process (is that normal?).

She is admitted, given lots of morphine. Still massive bowel pain. Doctors take CT scan, but nurse tells us three days later it was ""not added to her charts"", which she said meant no-one had looked at them. Doctors give her several kinds of laxatives, both oral and rectal, as well as two enemas. Nurses are very worried about the size of her stomach, doctors are seemingly unconcerned. Today they give up and call in a third doctor, who orders a new CT scan. This doctor looks at the CT scan and realizes her boweles have ruptured, and asks for immediate surgery.

She is in surgery as we speak.

**My Questions**

I'm looking for two specific things: 

Foremost, what is the best course of action for us as relatives to help her? For instance, what can we do to get her to another hospital (given her medical conditions), and is that a reasonable thing to do? Nearest hospital is 1 hour away.

Second, in Sweden, there is a mechanism, Lex Maria, when things like this happen where the hospital will report itself and an independent party will do a review of what occured. If applicable, this third party would then force process changes or augmentations. Is there a similar process in the US? We're not looking to sue the hospital, but want to ensure we do what we can to make sure this does not happen again. For instance, had someone looked at her first CT scan that might've led to earlier change of course in treatment, and the incident where the doctor did not realize he'd punctured her lung could perhaps be mitigated by better post-operation routines, and so on.

I suffer from hyperhidrosis which is excessive sweating caused by hyperactive sweat glands. It happens for me mainly in the armpits. Because of this sweating I've developed anxiety and whenever I go into public or I'm around a lot of people my anxiety gets worse hence I sweat much more. I barely ever sweat when I'm at home but once I go out into public the magic happens.


I became a heavy weed smoker for about a year because it helped my sweating dramatically, but I just had to stop because I was becoming physically addicted. Before I stopped I noticed however that if I for smoke for about 24 hours my sweating comes back and this time it's much worse than before I used to smoke. Since I stopped I smoked again a few times and on every occasion my sweating has increased dramatically once the weed looses effect.


I have also noticed that my sweating gets considerably worse when I watch porn (which I don't do any more) play a lot of video games, and when I use the internet a lot. I'm no psychologist/doctor or anything but it has become clear to me that every time I do something that releases a lot of dopamine into the brain my sweating/anxiety gets significantly worse. Just some extra information: I have had this problem of hyperhydrosis since about the age of 14 and I'm 20 now. From age 14 I was a heavy gamer and I would spend up to 16 hours some days just playing online video games. I don't know if my thyroid has anything to do with it but when I drink water I urinate quite frequently and sweat even more. 


I have spoken to my doctor and she only recommends Botox to stop the sweating but noticing that the dopamine surge causes me to sweat significantly worse I think it may be more than hyperhydrosis that we're dealing with. I appreciate any comments/advice that you have to offer and who do you suggest I turn to for help?
Forgive any grammatical errors. I'm using my cellphone to write this and it's mission impossible almost.


(EDIT) I've tried antiperspirants and I haven't had good results with them. Doesn't seen to make much of a difference

My wife came home late from work and she was acting weird. She wasn't answering the questions I am asking and instead she was saying stuff that doesn't make sense. I asked if she had anything to drink but couldn't get any answers. I went to bed but couldn't sleep. A couple hours later I heard some noise from the living room. She had opened the windows and saying it's so lovely out there and a new day is about to begin. She had this cheering tone in her voice. Then she proceeded to the apartment door to leave. She was saying she has to walk in this beautiful day and cannot stay indoors. That's where I tried to stop her. She started fighting with me. I was literally begging her to stop but she got away anyways. I couldn't follow her because our 2 yr old daughter was sleeping and I couldn't risk leaving her behind. She did not come home and I was sick worried. I called the police and they found her 2 hours later in a park nearby. She wasn't herself and wasn't answering any questions. Now, we are in the hospital and she doesn't recognize me or our daughter. Attending doctor is coming shortly and will perform an assessment. As I sit here in the hospital room, I am beyond worried because this is the first time this kind of stuff is happening in our 8+ year marriage.
She was having hard time at work and was stressed in the last few days but it wasn't too unusual for the to be busy. I am very worried and scared. What is happening to her? I tried Googling stuff but was very limited with a crappy cell phone, I decided to type this out to Reddit.


Also, since I am on my cell and English is not my first language, I left some stuff out but nothing major.

Since February, I have been noticing strange wrinkling on my fingers. It started on my thumb and spread to my index fingers and then across the rest of my fingers, reaching my baby finger last week. I have included pictures [here](http://imgur.com/a/O5nB5) although the lighting isn't great.

Basically it looks like I've had my hands stuck in water for a while, all the time. Skin is also dry and feels tight when I stretch my fingers straight.

I was at my local doc 2 weeks ago and asked about it. She said it looked like sweat, although my hands and feet are usually quite cold. She also said to keep an eye on it. 

It doesn't cause me any pain. I'm just curious as to what's causing it.

The first time I was in ceramics class and I was listening to a critique and then next thing I know everyone is looking at me and asking if I'm ok and I'm on the ground and I don't remember a thing. I felt fine after. The next two times I was alone at my house so I have no idea what happened, I just remember working on dinner and then I'm on the ground, felt like it was only a second. 

The most recent time however was kind of different and this was yesterday. I was with 3 of my friends at their house we were just hanging out and I start getting my stuff together because i had to meet up with my boyfriend, and then (I don't remember a lot) but my friend was holding my arms trying to keep me balanced and I was totally out of it. Then I was on the ground so I tried to get up and she helped me stand up and I went to go down the stairs and I totally lost consciousness again and fell down the stairs pretty hard (apparently, like I said I don't remember really any of this) and then they helped me up again and I don't know what happened but I remember seeing really bright light and I was outside and I guess I fell down again and then got up, passed out again, and they carried me to the front steps and I was able to kind of ""wake up"" at that point and I was feeling super weird the rest of the day, but I think that was just cause I hit my head really hard. I also pissed myself. And the whole process from the first time I passed out to when I was able to get myself awake and had control of my body was about 10-15 minutes. I don't remember much at all, most is totally black and I have some fuzzy memories of parts of it.

I've had 2-3 more of these (one at a time, each lasting about a week). One of them was in my right armpit. Now only one of them (the most recent, started 2-3 days ago) is noticeable and painful.


From online research, my guess is that these are swollen lymph nodes. The soonest I could get a doctor's appointment was June 25 - could this be important enough to go to urgent care in the meantime?

The window of the first film is set to assess lung tissue, not bone (which is why the ribs are so white). On a computer, one can easily change the setting, here you would need to print them again. 

The best way get a second opinion would be to obtain the original image files in the DICOM format, usually the CT system lets you export these on a CD-Rom.

EDIT: now I understand you mainly want to see the 2 specific findings. That is not that hard to see. The lung bleeding is visible in the left lung (on the right side in the pictures), for example on image 41 to 51 of series 2, the last two photographs you took. It is the grey area in the dorsal (towards the back) side of the left lung. On image 5 (12th picture, bottom row, middle image) you can see the blood from the side (sagittal) view. Again, it is dorsal, so near the back (in this picture, the right part of the picture) and caudal (towards the legs) of the lung.

The rib fractures are harder to see.

Please understand that this isn't a second opinion of the CT scan, I'm not a radiologist, I've just pointed out where the findings as you describe them can bee found on these images. ",t1_ci2tq90,2.0,AskDocs,Ulsenius,ci2ucix,1402303758,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,27o93w

 - I have eczema, was prescribed prednisone for a severe breakout. Prescribed dosage was: 40 mg for 3 days, 30 mg for 3 days, 20 mg for 7 days, 10 mg for 7 then stop. 

After the second day of 40 mg, I found myself unable to sleep. In an effort to lessen the side effects, I went straight to 20 mg for 7 days. Afterwards, of course, I had excess medication so I took 10 mg for 14 days. I just took my last pill and I have been pretty concerned with the fact that my adrenal glands likely became acclimated to the medication after being on a constant dosage for more than a week. My question is, how badly should I worry? Need I go see a doctor right away in order to get a refill so I can properly taper? 10 mg is likely a small dosage but even then, is 14 days enough to become dependent on it?

I have borderline Chronic Kidney Failure from Glomerulonephritis originating at age 13. Six months ago, I had my first baby. My pregnancy was difficult. I experienced severe resistant hypertension, gestational diabetes insipidus, and preeclampsia. Premature delivery was indicated at 30 weeks. I refused to deliver (against medical advice) and gave birth to a healthy child at 37 weeks. 

Now that we have a new baby, we love him and would like to give him a sibling. I need to get a better understanding of my condition and how it would be impacted by another pregnancy. 

I have not received a strong answer from my nephrologist. I can understand why he may not want to commit to any particular outcome. However, the quality of life for me and my family may be dependent on my decisions. 

Since the information I could receive from my physician would be limited and subjective, I would like to pursue researching it independently. Are they any subscriptions or medical resources that one could recommend ????

They are OB/gyn's who do a fellowship to specialize in high risk pregnancy. They will be the best to advise you as to what your actual risks are and work with you during the pregnancy if you choose to go ahead with it.

The most anybody on the internet can possibly tell you is this: everything gets tougher with the second pregnancy. Best case scenario is that it is the same as before. Nothing (save labor time decreasing) actually improves with the second pregnancy. It is a very serious undertaking and it could very well be a significant risk to both your life and that of the unborn child. It could also leave you in complete kidney failure requiring dialysis for life. It could lead to stroke or heart damage.

&gt;Since the information I could receive from my physician would be limited and subjective, I would like to pursue researching it independently

These are all things you can find anywhere online (and more). But none of them actually mean anything particular to *you*. That is why you need a physician to actually look at you, examine you, do all necessary tests, and use his or her years of expertise to come up with an answer. For something this serious, you are gambling a very big hand if you try and lead the way on your own on the internet. Your physician's input would indeed be subjective - subject to years of specific education, training, and expertise that you (and I) don't have. I can assure you that trying to research it yourself will lead to frustration and no answers at best or wrong answers and tragedy at worst. There is simply no ""resource"" that could possibly provide you with the information you seek, nor could you put it into proper context. There is a reason why we go to school for so long and then do residency *and* fellowship afterwards. Coming up with answers like this requires a deep and wide knowledge base. If questions this complex could be accurately answered from just some resources online, medical school and training would be a heck of a lot shorter. And do not make the mistake that your own research would be objective. You will be highly subjective and biased, both by your own experience with the first pregnancy and your emotions regarding desire for a second one. That is not a failing - it is a facet of being human. Which is why we as physicians do not treat our own family members for serious conditions nor do we treat ourselves.

26 / M / 5'11"" / 115 lbs / Caucasian / UK

Not really sure where to start, so I'll just spew out relevant details as they come to me. Both my father and his mother died in their 60s from bowel cancer. Don't know family history any further back than that. I've always been pretty underweight, as was my father when he was young (although he put on a fair amount of weight in his 30s). Don't know anything else about my grandmother other than that she died of bowel cancer.

For about the last 6 years I've had horribly itchy unexplained rashes showing up on my hands, for which I've been prescribed both anti-fungal creams and anti-histamines, neither of which helped noticeably. Was told it's likely an allergy, and have excluded at least the cat and milk from that list. From my extremely limited testing, the rashes seem to correlate with gluten consumption, but honestly my diet depends so much on things like cheap pasta and cereal that it's pretty much impossible to cut it out for more than a day or so just on a hunch. I eat pretty healthily though, I cook things like lasagnes, curries and stir-fries every day so get plenty of veg.

I'll try to keep talk of bowel movements brief; they usually float and seem fairly loose, and are a bit of an unstoppable force first thing in the morning. However, if I don't have pasta for dinner and skip my bedtime snack of cookies and crisps (doesn't happen very often) it's sometimes hours before I can go the next morning, and they tend not to float or stink as much. This wasn't always the case, they used to sink normally and were not regular enough to notice a pattern. I also pass wind a lot these days, where when I was younger I never used to (although I did love a good burp).

I understand fatigue is also a symptom, but since I smoke a lot of weed I can't really say for certain whether I suffer from that. I do find myself falling asleep at the computer a lot if I don't binge on coffee after breakfast, where I used to sit up for days at a time doing the same things, but I guess that might just be a symptom of getting older and getting over the insomnia I suffered when I was younger.

Finally (doubt it's relevant, but just in case) I've been suffering from back pain for about 8 years, but pretty sure it's just due to lack of physical activity and poor posture.

Sorry for the wall of text, it seems kinda obvious what the answer's going to be having just listed basically all the symptoms, so I guess I'm wondering why my doctors have never tested me for it. I only found out about it by searching for causes of rashes, and it seems like it's quite a common thing, so shouldn't it be one of the first things they check for, given that I've been underweight all my life despite eating fairly well, and my family history? Do they know something I don't? Is it possible both my father and grandmother had it without knowing, or is it more likely I'm just trying to make it fit and finding symptoms that aren't there?

Thanks in advance for any advice, have to wait anywhere from 2-4 weeks for a doctor's appointment here and even then they're not very helpful, so really don't like going unless it's absolutely necessary.

My GP took a cortisol blood draw in the AM and it was really low. It was 1 mcg/dL. He said that's very low so he did a second drawing a week later and it was 0.8mcg/dL.

Tylenol induced liver failure is also not a quick suicide. It takes days to weeks to die from that. But you do feel absolutely terrible in those weeks and no, doctors will not sedate you when the first symptoms start. Don't forget: doctors want to keep you alive so they will do whatever there is in their power to keep you around. Unless it is utterly hopeless but that takes a few days to figure out (in which you will suffer).

In this disease, people (usually young overweight females) have a higher pressure in their brain. The cause of this is not entirely clear. The main symptoms are headaches and visual problems.

While doing the spinal tap, the doctor can measure the pressure in your CSF space: cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flows in and around your brain and along the length of your spinal cord.

After measuring the pressure, some CSF will be obtained and send off to the laboratory.

The most important treatment of IIH is weight loss. Additionally, there is a drug that lowers the pressure (acetazolamide). Sometimes, frequent spinal taps are necessary to lower the pressure.

A spinal tap is a very routine procedure, usually not more painful than the placement of an IV. At the level where the needle is placed, there is no more spinal cord, only nerves that are floating in a bag of CSF. Therefore, there is no (or very very small) risk of spinal cord damage.

There are numerous causes, which cannot be differentiated without a good physical exam and possibly blood work. One can speculate endlessly about the causes over the internet but then you may as well just look at the entire list of differential diagnoses for secondary amenorrhea. Things like drugs (other than contraception) can cause it. So can stress. So can polycystic ovarian syndrome. Thyroid disorders also. Or even over-exercising, being underweight, or just significant weight loss in a short time. 

The vast majority of them are benign. The most serious are what are called pituitary adenomas - basically a tumor of the pituitary gland. The vast majority of the time these are not malignant, but they either compress the pituitary causing hormone changes or they secrete extra hormone that can cause the amenorrhea. Even when I say ""most serious"" they are readily treatable and people very, very rarely die from them or have serious lasting consequences. They almost always require surgery, which sounds scary, but is rather commonly done and pretty straightforward. They go in through the nose while you are under anesthesia. There is one surgeon I've read about who is so good he does them in 5 minutes flat. Most of the time they are a 15-30 minute surgery. Sometimes they will give you medicine first to shrink it if necessary. 

If it is a compressive type it will show up on a scan. If not, they will be able to tell by blood work. The things to look out for on yourself are:

if you begin lactating that is nearly a sure sign that this is likely the case (meaning milky fluid dripping from your nipples or even just obviously engorged, slightly tender breasts)

if you start noticing the your peripheral vision is starting to get worse or go away (this is called bitemporal hemianopsia and is reversed after the surgery, not permanent and is also a nearly sure sign of compressive adenoma)

if you have any other changes in vision, sudden or unremitting headaches, or other neurological signs. 

If any of these things happen that is a sign for you to finish your trip and go back home to be seen by a doctor. If your condition worsens same thing.

I am a 28 year old male who is (was?) in great shape.  I am an avid weightlifter, but I hurt my left bicep in February trying to push a car out of the snow.

It was very painful, and i felt two or three strands of something wriggle from the left side of my elbow diagonally across my upper arm. The pain stayed with me for a week or two.

I saw a doctor right away, who ran me through some strength/mobility tests and felt for my tendon.  He said the tendon was still there, and he told me stay off it for two weeks and then work myself back up.

I did what he said, but after about three months my bicep improvement plateaud and it is permanently shortened by about an inch, maybe almost two.  It is still weak and there is tightness when my arm is in certain orientations.

I decided to go see an orthopedic surgeon and he thought it might be a partial tear.  I got an MRI a week ago. The report said the tendon is properly inserted without rupture, and that I had a grade 1 strain of the distal musculotendinous junction. I'm assuming that it must look like a grade 1 strain now, four months later.

My surgeon reviewed the MRI with me and placed me in physical therapy, but he didn't really take the time to explain to me what my options are (if I have any), why he made the decision he did, or what he thought happened. This surgeon seems capable, but I'm the kind of person that needs an explanation.

I don't know what proper etiquette is for getting more information. I have a follow up appointment with him in six weeks, but I would like answers to my questions before that. Especially because I have this feeling that if there IS some procedure that can make this better, I should get it done as soon as possible.

Is there a right way to get in touch with him sooner?

Also, this is my arm and this is going to affect me seriously for the rest of my life, so I was interested in getting a second opinion. Are there certain things I should or shouldn't do when I set up an appointment with a different surgeon? I've heard 2nd opinions can make doctor's uncomfortable. I'm really just looking for someone who will communicate better with me, and perhaps explain why PT is my best option right now.

I know the internet is not the place to get medical advice, and I know I am not qualified to make a prognosis.

Background:  Mom (60) had a triple level spinal fusion in October 2012 in the three joints above the S1 joint.  I do not know the specific issues but the pain and advanced issues in her spine were so bad that multiple surgeries were expected.  They have not been able to be done because she has been fighting staph infections on her face and other infections in her mouth since January.

The metal frame and screws have stayed in place but (in layman's terms) the S1 joint is degrading and her spine above the triple fusion is curving away to where you can see the hardware through her skin.

She is on a plethora of pain medicines - pain patch, ultram, towen (spelling), etc but the pain broke through hellishly this week.

She went to the kidney doctor believing she had a kidney stone but they found nothing.  She can no longer stand upright and certain movements cause her to almost blackout for the pain.

She's being taken to her surgeon on Monday to be assessed for emergency surgery.

The surgeon did a lot of consulting before he did the first one due to the complexity and severity of her back.  Everything was so bad that identifying what needed to be done first was very difficult.  

If it can't be fixed (likely), what's the worst case scenario?  Is deliberately paralyzing her from the waist down an option if it would make the pain stop?  Can they put nerve blockers in?

She can't stand to lie down flat so they are going to put her under for a CT scan on Monday.

This is a terrible situation with no answers.  I just want to know if there are drastic answers that could give her a pain free life - no matter what they could be.

Images after her triple fusion in case interested.  The resolution is such that I don't expect any usefulness from them.

  There is often pain/discomfort when defecating, it's not bad but I have a fairly high pain tolerance.

  I have resorted to most of the time not even using paper to wipe, when I am done I hop in the shower and gently run water over my anus to clean it.

  It bled especially bad today.  I reached back there and lightly touched around the anus area and felt around.  My fingers came back with a fair amount of blood on them.  I could feel a small bump somewhere on the sphincter.  If I press or poke this bump, it seems to bleed more, suggesting this is the source of the bleeding.

* underweight, high cholesterol, low blood sugar, low iron, tl;dr low everything :c


BACK GROUND:
I got my first period around 11 (estimate), and would get one every year, except for some times where I would get 2 or 3. So up till last year I had only had 7 periods within a 4 year frame. I'm an athlete and am ""underweight"", which I don't think is true since I actually have quite a lot of fat and muscle spread around my body ( more so my face and tummy). After some really dramatic doctor negligence landed me in the hospital with a severe kidney infection that could compromise my appendix, I switched doctors (male to female now). I am much more comfortable with her, she's young, speaks english, and is female. Whereas my old doctor was old, male, and just a pediatrician. Also if anything I'm an athlete (long distance runner xcountry+track) and an honor student, too young to work, with strict but loving parents.


Well my first visit with her I told her about my period-less life so far, so she took my blood and ran a lot of tests. When we came back she told us how unhealthy I actually am. She said I was underweight (92 pounds) and put me on a low cholesterol diet that I actually followed. I was SUPPOSED to go back in 3 months (I went december and was supposed to return March) but my mom never took me back. It's now June.


OK so I'm done with my background which I'm sorry if it's too long and redundant.
Well now that I've followed my diet and gained weight (I hated this, I already have a lot of stomach/face fat and I look pregnant, while my legs are really muscular and toned and arms are just loose noodles. Sooo disproportioned). But here's the thing, I take centrum vitamins (for women) and after taking them for 2 days I got my period. I stopped taking them because when I'm on my period I 

* hate moving  
* religiously change my pads because I hate the dirtiness of a period (8 days long w/ no symptoms at all, like cramps) 

because I think it's uncomfortable and hate having that ""wetness"" of blood for a week straight. I have since started taking the vitamins so that I get my period the first of every month, and it's worked.

Now my question is, can I even get pregnant if this is how my body ""works""? Since I get to dictate WHENEVER I want to get my period does my egg even get released, nonetheless is it able to be fertilized? I am sexually active (1 partner, were both virgins) but obviously wouldn't want kids at this age. I wouldn't be able to ask my doctor for birth control because my mom comes into the room with me and she would know I'm having sex. Because of a lot of drama with her abusive ex and his daughter (who got pregnant at 15). If she found out she would (understandably) make me stop seeing my boyfriend who is my best friend of 4 years and boyfriend of almost 1, and probably ground me till I leave for college (slight exaggeration but true). I don't know what my question is really, but what is my body doing, can I get pregnant? How should I approach my doctor with the notion that I would like to take any type of birth control but still have my mom not know about the sex.?

tl;dr I am sexually active and induce my own periods using vitamins. I am wondering if I can even get pregnant, and how I could go about getting BC without parent knowing I'm doing the do.

1) your periods are not regular and few. As I understand, you state that you can induce your periods with taking vitamins? I highly doubt that. I am not aware of any vitamin supplement that can have such an effect. Could it be that it was just a coincidence? 

4 years of irregular menstrual cycles after your first period is quite long. Your doctor already had done some testing, which is reassuring, but I would like to see some follow up.

2) You say you exercise intensively. As far as I know, a BMI of 18 doesn't indicate underweight in 15 year old girls, but BMI is not the only indicator of that. You certainly are not fat. Your remarks about how your body looks do concern me a bit; girls your age can be prone to eating disorders or 'hypergymnasia'. 

Excessive exercise, combined with low body fat (even when not underweight) can certainly influence your menstrual cycle

3) You really dislike your menstrual cycle. I do understand, and as a man I can't speak from experience, but you do have to agree with me that menstruation is a normal part of a woman's live. Can you discuss your hygiene concerns with somebody you trust? Perhaps there are products that better suit you.

4) I think this is the most important part: **YOU CAN GET PREGNANT EVEN WITHOUT REGULAR MENSTRUATION**. The risk of getting pregnant is lower than if you would have a regular menstrual cycle, but there certainly is a risk. You need to use contraception.

If you can't talk to your doctor about other forms of birth control, you would need to use condoms. They are readily available.

5) You can't discuss this with your doctor because your mom always accompanies you to your appointments. Where I practise, children 12 and older can make an appointment with the doctor's office and come alone if they really don't want their parents there. I'm not sure how that works in your area. Would it be possible to call ahead to the office and ask them to inform your doctor that there are things you would like to discuss with her without your mom present? That way, the doctor can help you. Again, I'm not sure if a physician can do so in the US (where I guess you are located).",t3_286myj,8.0,AskDocs,Ulsenius,ci7z4ur,1402819126,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,286myj

Ok so I've been getting kidney pain every couple of weeks. It will come and go, this has been happening for a few months now. I've had a kidney infection before so I know that the pain is in fact coming from my kidney's. And a few months back I got really sick (nausea, dizziness, loss of appetite, exhaustion, and EXTREME kidney pain) so my doctor had sent me for blood tests only to find out that my kidney function was rather low (also tested for diabetes which came back negative). She told me to stay away from acetaminophen &amp; ibuprofen for a few days, which I did. She sent me on my way and that was that. I'm rather aggravated that she had no interest in finding out exactly why my kidney's weren't/aren't functioning properly. And like I said I still continue to get kidney pain every couple of weeks. I've made an appointment and am going to demand she send me for either a CT scan or an ultrasound on my kidney's tomorrow. But in the mean time I would like another doctor's opinion on what the hell could be wrong with my kidney's. This just isn't normal.

Also, I woke up the other day not being able to move my head to the left without my neck seething in pain. I chalked this up to maybe just sleeping funny or something, but this neck pain has been persisting for a few days. I've also noticed either a lump or swollen gland on my neck which seems to be where the pain is coming from. It's pretty small but I'm wondering if this should be cause for concern?

I have Sphincter of Oddi Dysfunction and am anemic. I am on a feeding tube. I probably should call my Doctor but I thought I'd get a feel for things here first. I am constipated. So very constipated. I am currently withdrawing from Oxycodone (Down to 10mg) and am off the Methadone (last dose about 1mg 11days ago). 

Poop Drugs I am taking:

* Docousate 2x/day
* Miralax 3x/day
* Ducalax 1x/day

Other drugs I take:

* Abilify 10mg 1x/day
* Lyrica 50mg 3x/day
* Iron 3x/day
* Ativan 1mg PRN (last used about 30hrs ago)

Anyway, I haven't gone in 3days - I swear when it all comes out I'm going to loose 6-8lbs. My abdomen is very distended and tender to touch also it is pressing against my feeding tube causing some pain.I haven't used an at home enema because I am on vacation and just haven't had access to the pharmacy but might go and get one. However, I'd kinda like to poop on my own.

So questions are:

How long should I let this go on for? What are other laxatives I can try? Aside from an enema. Should I seek medical attention at this point?

Benadryl is also something that has a lot of side effects, and isn't ideal...although certainly not the end of the world. Sleep medicines can be miraculous for people, although they certainly aren't for everyone. I think the friendly Chiropractor here is making them sound way more scary than they actually are. Some people have their lives changed by them.  

Regardless of that, he's right that medications are NOT the way to go unless you've tried everything else. The first thing a sleep medicine physician will tell you is to work on your sleep habits. Establishing good sleep habits is essential. Especially since you used to be a shift worker, your natural cycle (or circadian rhythm) may be off. (If you really want to try meds, melatonin supplements are a natural remedy that has been shown to help shift workers get back on a normal rhythm.)  

DOs:  
*You should try waking up at the same time every day and go to sleep at the same time.  
* Exercise daily.  
* Make bed the place where you do nothing but sleep (don't lie in bed watching TV or even read).  
* Google ""Sleep Hygiene"" to get a better idea of things.  
* Sleep at least 8 hours (although the necessary amount of time is different for everyone)  

DONTs:  
* Don't look at bright screens or smart phones within an hour of sleep.  
* Avoid alcohol or caffeine within an hour of bed.  
* Don't exercise within an hour of bedtime, but definitely exercise during the day.  
* Don't eat right before going to bed.  

The sleep medicine physician would also tell you to keep a sleep log, keeping track of when you fall asleep and wake up every morning. That way he/she would be able to get a good idea of what the problem is. Doing it yourself will make you stay honest about your bed time and when you get up.",t3_288v0y,2.0,AskDocs,youngerthanthat,ci9hff0,1402972870,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,288v0y

23, white Female, Florida, 5'4"" and 200 lbs (I totally dont look it... its hidden) (yes I had to defend being fat)
Lets start by saying I have always been sick. Ever since I was a kid ive had inflammation somewhere. I had strep 10 x a year until I got them removed at 14. I cant recall a time in my life when my stomach didnt bother me, up to this day. Ivr been on birth control since I was 15 to help with my pmdd and my hormones. I ld get terrible migraines and act insane. Id go from super happy to sobbing my life away when id drop a pen on the ground. This also happened to be the first time I openly told my parents I suffer from severe depression  I told them I often thought about killing myself, but they responded the worst way parents could respond. Asked me if I was on drugs, normal kids dont act like this, etc so I never brought it up to them again.
When I was 19, I started having hemorrhagic cysts on my ovaries (Ive also had severe pmdd since I started my period at 11). Ive had 3 cysts the size of grapefruits or larger, full of blood,  removed via Laproscopy from 2010-2012. I stopped taking my birth control because it was making me have what I assume are heart flutters (feels like someone tapping on my throat) but I havent had any terrible cysts since I stopped taking them (cross fingers). Then come october 2012, I get the worst pain of my life in my stomach. Go to hospital and after 6 days of testing and not finding anything, they do Laproscopy and see that my appendix has wrapped around my intestine, so they remove it and a small portion of my intestine. My life has not been the same since then. 
I started having mild ibs symptoms, my boyfriend at the time had it bad so I knew what I was looking for, assumed it was because my gi tract was adjusting to not having appendix to balance bacteria. Id say I had mild ibs symptoms from october 2012 until january 2014, when I lost my job.
I lost my job because... I couldnt stop shitting and puking. I went in for a shift and 4 hours in id done 20 minutes of work. Back and forth to a bathroom, sitting there with severe pain shooting from my rectum through my whole body and up into my throat.  I can only describe it as someone shoving one of those spiked maces into my colon. Not an exaggeration.
I went to the hospital and they did a ct scan, said everything looked fine. No inflammation, white blood cell count was a little high, found blood in stool and a few fissures but thats it. Reccommended I follow up with primary care physician for colonoscopy. 
Its hard to get a colonoscopy when you have no job and no health insurance. Alas, ive been in and out of the hospital at least 4 times since the beginning of this year for the same symptoms: abdominal pain, puking mucousy looking crap, shitting bright green mucousy stool,  the only time its not green is when its black and bloody, feeling like I have to go to the bathroom 100% of my day, actually spending 30% of my day IN the bathroom (half of my bathroom trips are watery stool with a that bum mace feeling I described, since I hardly ever have anything in my system to expel), my BONES hurt and I dony know how else to describe it except for when you have a bad flu and all of your joints hurt, just times 5. I get migraines that last hours, always on my right side. My back constantly feels like someone hit me with a sledgehammer right where my kidneys are. Im severely depressed already and with all of this going on, I sometimes just dont want to go on anymore. I want to start over. New body. New life. I hate this one. Im bitter and hateful and angry because I spend all my time alone at home ""trying to get better"" when really its just me playing hide and seek with self pity. Ive been going to free clinics for help, stomach medication. Im on bentyl and Phenergan which... doesnt seem to help my stomach but it makes me super tired so I sleep through a lot of the pain.
Which brings me to anothet problem. For the past month or so... I have been crashing like ive never slept in my life. Ill be fine and all of a sudden, gone. Asleep. Wherever im sitting or standing. Ive never felt so tired to often in my whole life. Its INSANE. my doctors found glucose in my urine, thinking maybe its diabetes but they did a blood sugar test and ruled it out, since when they did the blood sugar I hadnt eaten in over 24 hours and my sugar was fine?
Im trying to get state healthcare so that I can get a colonoscopy done, but I swear if they say they dont see anything they might as well check me in to a psychiatric ward right there because  I will flip shit. All the shits. 
My friends mom, who is a retired nurse, thinks it could be lupus...but all my tests say otherwise, even though ive never been specifically tested for lupus. Then again all of my tests thus far have not indicated any inflammation or ulcers in my abdomen,  but I know something is wrong. You dont shit bloody mucous for months because youre healthy.
Ive tried changing my diet, ive tried excluding one type of food at a time to try to eliminate the culprit, but when the culprit Is your body and its trying to silently assassinate you, its hard to eliminate that... 
Sorry for the wall of text. Just looking for some insight... maybe some specific things to ask the next time I see a doctor. Questions welcome, I get so flustered talking about my problems and theres so MUCH to tell that I lose track of some important things.

Then something else cheap to try is a probiotic, which might help you feel better but won't affect whatever the underlying disease is. A magnesium supplement might decrease the frequency of your migraines.

1. The worst needle phobia I've ever seen. Last time, it took two hours to get an IV in, because he couldn't calm down. Arms clenched over his chest, red-faced, sweating, shaking, refusing to speak or respond to directions. They were worried he was going to pass out, he was so panicked. 

2. The anesthesiologist from his last surgery mentioned they used 3x the normal dosage for his height and weight to keep him sedated. She told me he wasn't awake, but his body was tensing up during the procedure and making it difficult for him to breathe. She said it could be a natural resistance (something about redheads), or it could be a high drug tolerance, due to the number of suppressants he takes for a migraine disorder. 

But my husband refuses to say anything about these issues to the surgery scheduler (partly due to pride, partly due to his phobia, and partly due to being annoying). I feel like the staff should be prepared for him as best they can.

So my question is two-fold: One, As his wife, should I say something to the surgery center in advance? Is that helpful information or would you proceed as normal regardless of the information? Two: If I should say something, who should get the information? The surgery center? The anesthesiologist? Can it wait until the day of the operation?

I just want the day to go as smoothly as possible for everyone involved, so any advice would be appreciated. Thank you in advance!

They had been there for years, no other little friends or clusters ever popped up so I just let them be. Finally I just wanted them to be gone, and tried apple cider vinegar on cotton balls, held on with band aids for a few days.  The burn got pretty intense but I stuck with it and now they are gone so hooray!  

So the acv left about a 1/2 inch in diameter area of raw skin on where they used to be. ( I've only stopped using the acv for 2 days now) It almost looks like a burn of sorts with fluid building up on the surface and the skin looking somewhat mangled.  I have faith this will heal on it's own, but I'd like to speed up the process, so is there anything that would be safe to use on sensitive skin to heal something like this?  I've heard using Neosporin doesn't allow air to the area which could allow for the warts to grow back?  I've thought of using liquid silver which has helped me in the past, but I wanted to get a better opinion before proceeding.

so i sometimes do have nosebleed and it's nothing serious most of the time, as the bleeding usually fades after like 2 minutes.

But today, I experienced something different: I just came home and I randomly got really bad nose bleeding, there were really drops of blood coming out of my nose, you can't call that bleeding anymore, there were really huge drops filled with blood dropping down my nose, and it lasted like 7 minutes.

If nosebleeds get really cumbersome, an ENT doc can zap the vessels inside your nose if there's one particular blood vessel that is causing a problem. Otherwise, they typically are not a sign that anything is wrong.

If you're concerned, certainly bring it up with your primary care doc, but you don't need to go to the emergency department if it stopped.

You did, however, tear off a small piece of your kneecap (on the portion facing your other leg) and a partial tear of the ligament that your kneecap tendon slides under (retinaculum). As a result your kneecap is displaced a bit towards the outside (away from your other leg). 

They are also saying there is more swelling, particularly in the back part of your lower thigh and and the fat pad behind your kneecap ([Hoffa's pad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrapatellar_fat_pad)). Some of the bone bruising you had before has gotten better. 

Basically, you have a messed up kneecap and ligament. This is itself causing pain, but also the fact that the kneecap is drifting to the outside means that when you extend your leg it is rubbing up against the bone and squishing Hoffa's pad, causing more pain and swelling. 

I'm not an othropod so I don't really know all the details on treatment options. This sounds like it isn't surgical, but I can't be sure.

**The problem**: Seldom, when i suddenly turn my head to the left, i feel a very sharp pain in the right part of the rear of the neck, right at the base of the skull, probably where the sternocleidomastoid tendon is connected (behind the ear). Please note that this does not mean that it's the one causing the problem, it's just to get an idea of the approximate location.

This pain subsides very quickly, in a matter of seconds, but it's excruciatingly painful (it feels as if a muscle has been torn) - after it subsides, there's a weird, spongy feeling that lingers for 5-10 minutes in the area.

Is this a sign of some deficiency, or is it just something that happens to everyone? Or is it a more serious cause of concern, and i should make an appointment to a specialized doctor for a live checkup?

I went to the hospital because it occurred with some chest pains.  The CT scan, MRI, Cardiac Artery US (less than 20% narrowing) were all clear.  No issues at all.  

Since the problems progressed, my neuro ordered a neck MRI which showed two bulging disc (c5/6 and c6/7) and narrowing at C7/T1.  Which from what I understand could explain my arm tingling.  Did an EMG and it was normal (no pinched nerves or permanent nerve damage).

The problem is the tingling because a lot worse after activity and has at times included a blurry spot on my right eye side of my vision (like the bottom right half of the eye).

My Neuro is sending me to a stroke specialist, but everything I have read about strokes says that the symptoms wouldn't be coming and going. After rest the numbness/tingling subsides.  But it will take a while to do so.  For example, I was at the waterpark all day Friday with my family carrying my 19 month old a lot of the time.  The issues started in my leg while we were there and by the time we were home it was my entire right side.  It was bad all night and into the next day.

Your specific case sounds strange and complicated and we don't know what it causing it. 

That said /u/cclark56 is *mostly* right. You've little to lose by trying. But there are a few things you should know and consider before and after trying it.

First off, the obvious stuff - it is illegal, even if you are in Washington or Colorado because you are under 18. 

Secondly, it has been demonstrated to increase the risk of developing psychosis and specifically schizophrenia in people who use it as teenagers. Specifically the risk drops off in the early to mid 20's but the peak is right at your age. That said, it is a small absolute risk increase and it is almost certainly not a *cause* but a *trigger*. Meaning that it triggers it in people susceptible to that. Also, it is for chronic use, with sporadic or short term use being much less implicated. If you have a family history of schizophrenia or other psychiatric illness I would strongly advise you to weigh the risks and only use marijuana as a last resort and only for a short time if you do. 

Next, marijuana has what are called idiosyncratic effects. Which means it does have, in some people, the exact *opposite* effect it normally does. Specifically, it can trigger people to vomit like crazy in a syndrome called cannabinoid hyperemesis. So it could actually make your condition even worse. This is a rare effect, but we don't know who it affects or why. It will most likely only last temporarily and once the marijuana has worn off it will pass. But be aware you could be intensely miserable.

Next marijuana is also known to trigger acute psychotic breaks. Once again this is like the other point about psychiatric issues in that it triggers it in susceptible people. It is also very rare, but it does happen. Most often when this does happen, the person can recover just fine, but sometimes hospitalization and treatment is necessary and very rarely it can lead to lasting effects. This is something to take more seriously if you have a family history of psychiatric illness. 

Lastly are functional issues. Smoking, particularly if you have never done it before at all but even if you smoke cigarettes (which you shouldn't if you do!!), can cause significant coughing. That coughing can lead to vomiting and has a specific name - post-tussive emesis. This is only an immediate effect of the cough itself, not the marijuana, but it can trigger a cycle of continued vomiting especially in susceptible individuals. 

So, knowing all these things if you still wish to try it, do it safely and with support from people around you that you can trust. I would honestly recommend you bring your parents into this conversation and have a rational upfront discussion to make it clear that you want to try this purely for *temporary* relief of your symptoms until a more permanent resolution can be had and that you would like their support and presence to make sure you do everything safely. At an absolute minimum have some non-idiot friends around who will be willing to call an ambulance if you need it for some reason (like a psychotic break or cannabinoid induced hyperemesis). 

Make sure and start out very slow and light and take your time. Particularly for your first time even smoked it may take as long as 30-60 minutes to feel an effect and some people don't feel an effect their first time at all. If you go the route of edibles, be *very* careful. They can be potent and will take a *minimum* of 30-60 minutes to have an effect. Do not take an extra dose because you think the first one wasn't enough. Wait at *least* 2 hours before doing that. And make sure you eat it on an empty or nearly empty stomach. This will help transit time and allow for a greater effect with a smaller dose. 

Marijuana itself will not be able to kill you or cause lasting damage outside of the psychiatric risks I mentioned. However, if you do have an adverse reaction and begin vomiting uncontrollably you could risk aspirating (breathing in) the vomit which can be very serious. Make sure you have a bucket near you just in case and someone to help hold you leaning forward or laying on your side, just in case. 

My intent is not to scare you away from trying this. The risks I mentioned are very small. Small but also real. You don't want to end up being that one crazy ass case of the kid who tried weed and died nor do you want to be that very uncommon case of the kid who tried it and had a psychotic break. I just want to inform you of the realities of this and let you make an informed decision based on that, as well as take precautions to be safe about the whole thing. (obviously you should not drive or go out anywhere if you try this. *If* it helps and you can handle yourself, going out walking may become OK but **never** driving). 

The biggest thing is to make sure you don't have any sort of family history of psychiatric illness, most specifically schizophrenia, because if you do that would be the single biggest reason *not* to try marijuana.",t1_ci9tdr8,9.0,AskDocs,nybgrus,ci9w7kf,1403021755,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,28d602

I am guessing I have always had some sort of heart palpitation brought on by exercise because every time I do cardio I get that ""heart feels like it skipped a beat"" feeling. 

Anyways, a couple months ago I was in a particularly hard workout class. It was our last workout so we wanted to make it difficult. Right at the end, my heart got that same feeling it normally does, but this time it sort of didn't catch right? I'm not really sure how to explain it, but it just started beating so fast and it was pounding really hard. I wasn't even exercising anymore, just standing there and I couldn't hardly catch my breath. It was just my heart and after calming down (it only lasted 15-30 seconds) it just ""caught"" right and went right to normal. I didn't think much about it, but it did feel sore for about a day afterward.

Since then I seem to get that feeling much more frequently. Now, though, it gets brought on by stress, exercise, and alcohol. 

So fast forward to a few nights ago. I had just finished have a couple drinks and was playing a game with some friends when I get that feeling. This time my heart is just beating fast (but not too fast) but every three or four beats it would do two or three super fast beats that also pounded hard. I was also having a hard time breathing and feeling dizzy. It last a few minutes than calmed down.

So my question is, does this warrant a visit to the doctor? Would they even do anything about it if it was beating normally when I went in?

One year ago, I began having a sharp shooting pain in the fingertips of both hands. Saw a doctor, and blood work was normal except for being slightly anemic. She said there was a possibility that low iron caused the pain, and prescribed a supplement. She also tested the reflexes in my arms and said that the left arm might have been slightly more pronounced than the right, but wasn't 100% sure. I still had the pain while on the supplement (about 1 month) and eventually it went away, after about 2 months from onset.


About seven months ago, I visited the doctor again due to chronic pain in both knees for about a month and a half. Standing up, sitting for long periods of time with knees bent, or going up/down stairs hurt very badly. Doc found no damage to the knees or connecting ligaments, and said it was likely patellofemoral pain syndrome. This went away after about three months from onset. I have zero pain in either knee now.


Currently, and for the past three months, I have been experiencing diarrhea, gas and intestinal discomfort. Doc ruled out bacteria and parasites, and blood work was normal. Recommended I see a specialist, and I have a GI appointment scheduled soon. Diarrhea comes in spontaneous ""attacks"" and seems to be entirely unaffected by what I've eaten or whether I've eaten at all.

These sorts of things need an extensive history to diagnose and rule out anything serious. There are any number of a huge things that this could be and it will be honestly impossible for anyone to give an answer over the internets, no matter how much more 2nd-hand over-the-net history you provide.

**I want to be clear that what I am about to say is not a diagnosis**

The thing that jumps into my mind are a number of red flags that make me want to rule out [vascular dementia](http://www.alz.org/dementia/vascular-dementia-symptoms.asp) or [TIA](http://www.strokeassociation.org/STROKEORG/AboutStroke/TypesofStroke/TIA/TIA-Transient-Ischemic-Attack_UCM_310942_Article.jsp) or even just frank recurring small strokes (they are all on the same spectrum of condition and inter related). 

Her strange word choice is suggestive of ischemic damage (stroke or TIA) of specific parts of the language center of her brain. The forgetfulness could be because of vascular dementia. The headaches could be stroke/TIA as well, possibly in the visual cortex of the brain. The pill she is forgetting could be a high blood pressure medication. 

There could be any number of causes but it should be evaluated. 

It could be something totally benign. It could be that she is just stressed out and acting weird. It could be an endocrine problem (which is very common in women her age). It could be that she has started taking recreational drugs (I've seen it before). The point is it could be like a million things. But for whatever reason, those red flags about vascular dementia/TIA/stroke jumped out at me. **That does not mean it is the most likely cause of her issues**. In medical school we are taught to always think of the most common thing that could be causing our patients' problem and the things that could be the cause but may kill them. I can't possibly tell what is the most common, but this is the thing that could kill her. So from my perspective as a physician, even if it is a very small chance that it could be the case, it is still worth checking out because missing it would be huge.

Obviously if something dramatic happens take her to the ER. Otherwise schedule an appointment with a doctor and have her get checked out. She sounds like she may be downplaying the whole thing, so ask her up front if you could come along for the doctor visit. *Let her speak and do not interrupt her*. Only after she is done, if she has missed anything really important that you have noticed, *kindly* step in and mention a few things that have been really concerning you. You could even mention that you looked up stuff online and vascular dementia came up, but you don't know if that could be it and are just concerned it *might* be. And go from there. 

Oh and if this stuff has started suddenly and/or rather recently mention that specifically. If it gets worse very suddenly (we call it ""step-wise"" fashion) mention that as well.

Best of luck and I hope it isn't vascular dementia, but the best advice I think you can get it to go get it checked out and make sure that it isn't something serious.

-Severe fatigue that sometimes leaves me sleeping 18-20 hours per day.
-Constant joint and muscle pain that won't go away.
-Difficulty walking due to hip problems that aren't sciatica but cannot be explained either.
-Normal temp is 96.1, but for last year or so maintaining a fever of 99-100.
-Easy bruising and slow wound healing, with minor cuts and abrasions bleeding for extended periods of time.
-Intestinal issues ranging from diarrhea to constipation, pain and bloating.
-Hands shake constantly, regardless of blood sugar.

-Chronic Fatigue syndrome
-Fibromyalgia
-Unknown inflammatory issue

-Zovia 1-50 - Birth Control
-Gabapentin 300mg 3 times per day
-Tramadol 100mg at night, sometimes twice per night

Duration of complaint: have been feeling like crap for a long time - years and years. But CBC's always normal, BP is low. 

Location on body: chest pains, shortness of breath, GERD (trouble swallowing lately), stomach/GI tract, physical fatigue, muscle aches &amp; pains, hot flashes, flushing, revved feeling out of the blue for no discernible reason.

Any existing medical issues: treated with nexium 40 mg for past 8 years; was dx'ed with IBS but response to Bentyl proves otherwise; frequently suggested it's ""just anxiety"" but psychiatrist and PHD psychologist have both cleared me on that &amp; depression, referring me BACK to GP for more testing. 

Current medications: Nexium 40 mg

Diet: I am not on any funky diets. Over the years, I have tried every possible elimination diet to rule out intolerances etc, it is not that. It is not my diet. I do not vomit. It's true my diet could be better, if my stomach didn't feel like crap all the time, and I had the energy to shop &amp; cook. Despite these obstacles, diet is still way better than the typical american diet. Though my one fault is that I do have a salt tooth - I crave salt all the time. 

Possibly ignorant question but if one is constantly eating salt, all day long, wouldn't you expect high blood sodium, not low?

When I was young (10-12) and I would get a fever, at night when I would try to fall asleep, I would get these weird hallucinations. But I and my parents simply tallied them down to the fever and I moved on. From around age 10-14, I'd only get them when I was sick. But after 14, I could get them almost any night i became overly warm. And more came They invoked all senses. And there were a pretty vast variety of hallucinations to go off of.  One of them would be that a gigantic silver ball is chasing me. Another was that everything in my life had become giant/I had shrunk. Once I had a hallucination that there were numbers floating all around my room and I had to collect them in order. But the most reoccurring one is the most difficult to explain. My heart starts to race, and I get very sweaty, while this happens with all hallucinations (or whatever they are) it is much stronger as this one begins. I feel an odd pressure all around my body, and I start to feel very strange. But this is where I get the most frustrated because I can't do a better job of explaining it. The only thing I really can put together with it is every time I close my eyes I see a red cylinder. I usually panic with these and am able to just sit through them at most for 5 minutes. Then they become too much and I have to cool myself down. 

So what is going on? I am aware that it is some sort of reaction to warmth, but why is my reaction so strong? And why does it only happen as I'm falling asleep and warm, why not whenever I become too hot?

As far as I know: no. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is used to treat minor adverse effects, but its routine use is not recommended as there is evidence of diminished vaccine efficacy while using paracetamol.

I've developed an annoying facial twitch.  I think it started on Monday.  At first it was only a couple times a day, but today and yesterday it's been much more frequent, almost constant.

It's my left cheek, right under my eye. It tends to last for about 30 seconds to a minute.  The muscle is rapid-firing far faster than I would be able to do on my own (I also wouldn't be able to flex only that one muscle independent of the rest of my face anyway). Sometimes it's very small movements, barely perceptible.  Other times, they are clearly visible. I have watched them in the mirror a few times now.

Today and yesterday, the frequency has really gone up.  I've been awake for about four hours today and it's already happened dozens of times.  It's now less than five minutes between episodes.  

I used to get a similar twitch in my right tricep.  That's been going on for years but it's never more once every few months.  

I play a full contact sport.  I don't think I was hit in the head or anything like that recently.  I'm not experiencing any other problems with my head or neck.  I did, however, have a long scrimmage on Sunday and was probably a little dehydrated afterwards.  

It's seriously annoying and I'm really looking forward to it stopping.  My gut tells me it'll pass with some time, but the fact that the frequency has gone up so much makes me a little concerned.  Am I about to have a stroke or some shit?

I know the readings are usually something like 120/80 (not me), just an example that I know how the numbers work.

I was very anxious and had tachycardia during the appointment due to anxiety and she said my readings were 12.6 and it was normal, ok but how does she get the 12.6 number? I don't get it.

So I went into the garage to grab a coke and when I came back inside and sat down, I felt a sudden soreness in my arm.

About an hour ago I looked and thought it was a mosquito bite because it felt like one. There was a raised, rash-like bump at first, but there was also some skin (that I noticed was arranged in a circle) on top of it that was wrinkly. Kind of like after you burst a bubble and there is the loose skin that you can shift around, but there was no puncture and no bubble had been burst, although it hurt to touch. It was also sore for awhile.

Now an hour has passed, and the pain is gone, but I looked down and noticed that it had grown into a bump. It looks like a blister and it seems to be filled with liquid.

Knowing me, I am going to be worrying endlessly and losing sleep. Could anyone provide any insight on these two results from a CBC test? Would a lack of vitamin D cause an abnormal liver result? Or the other way around?

As for the LFT's... could be any number of things including randomness.

My doctor told me to take a vaginal cream called clindamycin phosphate. I took my first dose on Wednesday night. She told me to take half the applicator. I'm taking it because I had a cyrotherapy procedure.

Yesderday, Tuesday morning, I got two vaccines for a trip to Latin America, the typhoid shot and the yellow fever shot. The doctor told me that any side effects may include soreness and nausea. My arm that got the typhoid shot was sore for a day and a half, but is now fine, now that I've been moving it around. The yellow fever shot arm wasn't sore. I had a little nausea yesterday, but nothing unbearable. She told me not to be surprised if I have a big red spot by the shot, ""the size of a tennis ball"" even. I had a small redness this morning my mom commented on, though I'm wondering if that was from the bandaid. Any redness is now gone.

Because of the vaginal cream, though, I'm worried about the vaccines still being effective. Especially since I didn't have many side effects, and I got two shots. Last time when I got TD and Hep A, I had a sore arm for a few days, especially from the TD.

I'm supposed to use this cream for 5 weeks, and my doctor told me to get the meningitis shot too, as I am leaving very soon. Will this cream cause these vaccines' strength to weaken?

First post here.

I wouldn't normally do this, but it'll be a while before I'm able to see anyone about this. 

Started wednesday, foot was sore, got infected, pus came out but no blood. Few days later, after I put on some antibiotic and this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_bituminosulfonate

I noticed something growing on top of my little bundle of misery. It's red like blood, seems to be under pressure, but when I pierce it with a needle (after which I thoroughly clean it, the needle is also clean) nothing comes out. I'm walking bare-foot all day now, to let it all breathe. My toe is sore and swollen on the left, just besides my toenail. 

Now, I think it's just an ingrown nail, and that's easy to get rid off. I'm hoping on seeing someone about this monday, but that's quite a while. But the reddish thing left is just weird.

I have had poor health all of my life; I've seen lots of doctors and tried many things, but I always feel terrible. I am hoping to find some ideas on what to investigate, get checked out, or tests to run, or things to try. I am currently on trazodone for depression and 10 MG/day ritalin for ADD symptoms. Any ideas appreciated!

    General:   
    1. Overweight, ~110KG/240 LBS / 6'2 187 CM
   2.  Diagnosed with sleep apnea, during the tests I had experienced zero REM sleep but this was not brought up for some reason, curious what this might mean. I have a CPAP machine but I truly cannot stand using it. I have given it many tries but I can't use it. 
   3. Tired throughout the day. Classic sleep apnea symptom, but it really hurts the rest. Waking up is hard, and my motivation for doing anything suffers further as a result. I believe this is a key that worsens the cycle; more tired, less motivation, more depressed. I never get refreshing sleep, and I rely on caffeine to make it through the day. (Nothing too ridiculous, though, three-four coffees a day, no redbulls etc)
   4. Joint pains. My whole body goes through pain rotation duty, currently my right arm at the wrist, elbow, shoulder, neck, knees, and ankles feel swollen and throb slightly. My whole body hurts from time to time. 
  5. Asthma and allergies. I have always had them, but my asthma seems to be improving since birth. I still need to use the rescue inhaler, but its getting better.
   6. I infrequently get light headed when standing, and sometimes need to sit down to not faint. Blood pressure issues? 
   7. I choke very easily. I have to chew an 'excessive' amount (according to others all my life), and have several times felt the need to go to the hospital, unable to swallow something completely, with large amounts of mucus coming up and each swallow feeling like a dance with death. This happens maybe ~1 time a year or so. 
   8. Dry eyes. This might be just a symptom of allergies, but it belongs here; and I Felt like this should go in there, even though I don't know if I can describe this very well... sometimes it feels like my eyes want to be lazy, and it requires a lot of focus to keep them from blurring. I otherwise have excellent eyesight. This doesn't happen often. I tend to keep the eyes focused, but it automatically requires more effort. I hope that makes some sense.  
   9. Teeth have always had problems. I've had to remove three due to infections, failed root canals, etc. I have a metallic taste in my mouth very often. 
   10. Nose. I can't really breathe through my nose. I've had surgery to remove nasal polyps, it worked marvelously for about a month, but then they got blocked again, or it failed afterwards somehow. They are better than before the surgery, but I feel like I am breathing through a straw through my nose. 
   11. warts. I get them occasionally, they are located ""regionally"" and are recurring. 
   12. I am unusually weak, and have a very hard time with gaining muscle. 
    13. -Psychological: depression that does not respond to any medications I have tried (many). Worst is absolute lack of ambition, focus, or ability to do anything. Very flat emotions, no joy, fun or excitement. I don't recall ever being angry in my life, nor very happy.
-Have been diagnosed with ADD alongside depression, dopamine seems to be an issue. 
-very addictive personality
-Act impulsively, overspend on purchases, autopilot through important decisions that ought to be thought through. Often get strong cravings for terrible food (carbohydrates) that seem irresistible. 

I'm sure I am forgetting some things, if I remember I will add them back in here. Just though I would put this here and see if anything positive happens; I appreciate the time anyone takes to read this!

The ADD medications are relatively safe, even long-term.

I know you've been told this before, but weight loss is the number one thing, by far, that you can do for yourself. It will improve your sleep apnea, your fatigue/weakness, your mood, and your joint pain. Losing weight is really fucking hard, often harder than quitting smoking, but it would help you an incredible amount.

Losing weight is all about calories in and calories out. If you eat less, you will lose weight. There's no trick to it. Exercise is good for your body regardless of weight, and you should do it, but often isn't a great way to lose weight (because many people end up being more hungry and eating more).

Go see a dietitian. You should be of the mindset that losing weight is a full time job. Buy smaller plates to help with smaller portions. Drink lots of water. Stop eating right when you're no longer hungry (not when you're full). Snacks should only be fruits and vegetables. Use an app on your phone to keep strict count of all of your calories.

First of all, yes, this is the reason my username is TOILET_PUNISHER. That's what someone told me I was when I revealed this issue to them.

I usually go at about 4 days between poops. When they do come, they take 30-45minutes out of my day as I expell massive amounts of poop. On a poop day I may take one massive dump, then maybe an hour later return for a second massive dump. Sometimes in a particularly large dump I start to salivate and feel slightly sick, and I feel the need to spit out this saliva pooling in my mouth. Whats up with that? Also on time leading up to my eventual poop, I fart like CRAZY and it smells awful. Like the air is riding past all the backup poop and squeeking out.

This has just been the way it is as long as I remember - I noticed this was abnormal and it probably began when I was in my early teens. I am 22 currently. Also, I am male if that matters. As for recent years I run a LOT so exercise does not seem to improve my situation. I've also eaten extremely healthy in recent months, and that does not affect it much either. I don't think this can be due to a nutrition/fiber deficiency of some sort.

Now this isn't really uncomfortable or anything for me so I never really sought out a solution. The only downside being that I need to take unusually long dumps and that can interrupt things that need my attention or make for embarrasing situations.

So i switched to psuedoephedrine, which is supposed to be non-drowsy, and by some accounts even supposed to have a stimulant effect (it's apparently perscription only now because people were stealing it to make meth or something). HOWEVER, the psuedoephedrine has put me out like a light every time i've taken it?

Pseudoephedrine is not for allergies. Try claritin or allegra. The difference between that and benadryl though is that bendryl crosses the blood-brain barrier and gets you drowsy and the others can't. The mechanism of action is very similar though, so if benadryl doesn't help with the allergies, then the others aren't particularly likely to help either. But it is certainly worth a shot. 

If those fail then you can go see you doctor to get a prescription for some steroid sprays like Flonase. Those take a week or two of daily use to kick in, but they help a lot more for people when anti-histamines don't cut it. It must be used regularly to be effective though. 

Actually I just realized that Nasacort became OTC recently. You can try that if the claritin doesn't help (try the anti-histamines first though, you can always use them together if it is really bad).

The optometrist probably looked at your retina if he used an ophthalmoscope, which is the main instrument an ophthalmologist would use to diagnose retinal detachment. An optometrist is not the right person to diagnose retinal detachment, but obviously most of them would see the signs of a retinal detachment.

Most people have floaters. If these floaters are not dramatically increase all of a sudden, they probably aren't the consequence of retinal detachment.

Your nearsightedness is not large enough to really predispose you to retinal detachment and at your age retinal detachment would be quite unlikely.

**Magnesium:**0,83mmol/L

**Potassium:**3,7mmol/L

**Sodium:**138mmol/L

**Calcium:**2,34mmol/L

I'm on a constant battle with my symptoms. They include a lot:


GI-upset, IBS etc (actually much better now since starting to focus on my gut).



Brain-fog, poor concentration, anxiety, nervousness, light depression (much better now), general cognitive-decline like memory, verbal fluency etc.



Burning feet/sometimes tingly finger, very cold extremites sporadically, **muscle and joint pains**, weakness, occasional spinal chord pain (in the centre), general stiffness in muscles (especially upper back and neck)

Skin problems (**constant redness of face, cheeks just under eyes**)

Now, for the moment I'm thinking of Candida and been doing some stuff for that but I'm not fully sure. I've got a lot of shit out the toilet which would indicate that comparing to pictures I've seen. Now, I recently started Molybdenum for die-off and experienced greater clarity, concentration and some other stuff but also headache and a bit dizzy.


What worries me is that I've been taking regular high-doses of Vitamin C from time (1000-2000mg) to time as well as Zinc (30 mg) and not really supplemented with Copper (now also taking Molybdenum). I know those are antagonists to Copper so I'm worried about being low of that. BUT reading from symptoms they might include HIGH copper as well which is confusing. I'm scared about doing potential damage so I wonder what I should do now. Best thing is of course a test for it, but in my situation its not possible to get until around 2 months from now.

About 4 months ago I went to my mum for advice on weight loss. She saw I was desperate because I was nearing the 100kg mark (and I'm 5""3 so no its not healthy)

She gave me her Ritalin and said since I was diagnosed with ADD when I was a kid I should be safe taking it and it will save us a lot of time and money if I took her medicine instead of saving up to see a proper doctor about this.

Well, my concern is though it seems to work when it comes to my hyperactivity and suppresses my appetite I'm now experiencing symptoms and have been for 4 months. I have dry mouth, I feel sick and pain in the lower stomach, I feel and am shaky and I'm generally restless. 

I want to stop and switch to a more safe way of suppressing my appetite but my doctors say its too dangerous while I'm on anti-depressants.

My choices now are stop the Ritalin and get hungry/fat but not have those symptoms or continue with the medicine, the symptoms until I've lost enough weight to be healthy again. 

My doctor doesn't know I'm on the Ritalin because I'm scared of getting into trouble for drug dealing or something. 

Another thing I want to know is why does my stomach hurt when I take it? Is it dangerous or normal?

I was put on Cipro and Flagyl on last week and after taking just two pills for the evening, I didn't get any nausea but I did have a panic attack. I've never been to the ER in my life so I attributed it to that. I was prescribed these two antibiotics for what was assuredly a minor case of colitis (diagnosed at the ER) though I had a personal GI doc look at it and he told me that he thought it was a big overdiagnosed. I had been constipated for a good week/week and a half and he seemed to really agree that was the main agitator. I had some leg pain, mostly in my calf and knee and am not entirely sure if it was related to the drugs. The next day after feeling slightly allergic to it and having weird thoughts I went to the ER again and explained that the drugs might be having an effect on me and assured they weren't and to keep taking them. 

After taking the medicine for that day later, I had a terrible pain in my lower right side and thought I had appendicitis even maybe. Needless to say I eventually had to call an ambulance and stay in the hospital after a severe pain in my right side and burning in my stomach. They put me in a room since they said it didn't seem to be an emergency and I was there before they decided to do a colonoscopy/endoscopy on Tuesday. I drank the prep for that (awful stuff) and finally was able to get some relief for the night and felt like my usual self a bit more. I went into the colonoscopy/endoscopy on Tuesday morning only for them to tell me that everything came back completely clean. I still had some pain on my right side near my gallbladder so my GI did tell the hospital to go ahead and do an ultrasound just to check it. The ultrasound also came back clean. I have felt extremely foggy and had weird blurry vision for a while and random feelings of numbness and dizziness. 

The doctors sent me home yesterday as they couldn't find anything in my bloodwork or ultrasound or vitals and I've felt weird every since. They put it down to anxiety but I'm honestly scared it's something else. Before all this I was generally healthy at least in my mind (I'm only 22 years old and I hardly ever go to the doctors with problems.) Am I really just anxious or does anyone think this may be a misdiagnosis? I was put on anti-depression medicine and told that it would subside eventually.

I hope I followed all the advice on how to post correctly.

I've been struggling with fatigue for several years. I'm 23/M/6'1''/90kg. I usually have to take a 30min nap at least once to get through with the day.

My life routine so far has been trying to sleep better on days when I have no deadlines and feeling too tired to work on those days. Then on deadlines, I have a burst of anger for not having done stuff before and do all the work in that day/night... I have lots of stuff I want to do but usually feel too tired to do them...

More information:

- Blood work in Jan of this year was normal (including T levels) except
Vit. D was slightly below 30ng/dl. Have been taking 30.000UI D3 since January but didn't experience anything different.

- Tried multivitamins for long periods of time. Didn't help.

- Tried blue-blocker glasses. Didn't help. (surprised they didn't work after reading many studies on how sunlight regulates circadian rhythm)

- Going outside to see sunlight after waking up for a few minutes in the morning for didn't help.

- Tried several different sleep schedules. When I sleep about 8h or less, I feel tired and have a headache. If I sleep as much as I want, I wake up feeling tired and irritated.

- Don't snore and usually wake up once at night after 4 hours to urinate.

- I don't skip meals. I can post detailed diet if necessary.

- Not exercising lately but when I did go to the gym in previous years for several months I didn't notice any significant improvement.

- Tried melatonin 3mg twice. Slept terrible and woke up constantly with headaches. I ordered 300mcg ones to test.

- I use a sleep mask every night to block light.

- During the last months, I have been occasionally feeling one of my nostrils blocked at night. Would that be enough to wreck my sleep?

- Not sure if important, but sometimes I suffer mild RSI in hands/arms but this was greatly relieved with an ergonomic keyboard.

- I drink a lot of water.

Could this be sleep apnea even though I'm so young and don't snore? Is there any other information you need?


Thanks a lot for your help!

I just started taking Osteo Bi-Flex Triple Strength with 5-Loxin Advanced Joint Care to try to reduce the pain in my knees and ankles, if not potentially repair some of the damage. Today is the 3rd night taking it. Since it says to take it with food, I take it at dinner. 

The day after I first took it (Thursday), I was extremely tired. I literally could only stay awake for approximately 2 hours before needing to take a nap. I was pretty tired today (Friday), too, but not nearly as bad as yesterday. I needed a nap late in the morning. When I woke up, I took Excederin for my headache and I think the caffeine helped me stay up.

Is it possible that the Osteo Bi-Flex is causing my fatigue? Or is it more likely just a coincidence and I just had a tired day?

My stats:

Age: 27
Sex: Male
Race: White
Pain location: Knees and ankles
Pain cause: Worked at an outside music venue for a few years. Walking up and down the steep, uneven hills damaged my knees and ankles. I also broke my foot there and it never fully healed because I walked on it too soon, so that hurts, too. 
Relevant conditions: Not sure if relevant, but am diabetic (type 1). 
Medications: Taking the Osteo Bi-Flex now. Also using Aleve and BioFreeze for pain management. Oxycodone when it's really bad (seems to be worse when it's raining, but could be psychosomatic - not sure. 

If you think the Osteo Bi-Flex is the problem, is there anything I can do? The reviews on Amazon say it's amazing, but takes a week to work. I'd like to see if it does work after a week before giving up. :/

I have been becoming increasingly affected since I have started properly drinking over the past year - I would be able to drink double this originally with no ill-effects to follow. Slowly my tolerance has been going down and down until like it is now.

I fear that this may be because of liver damage i.e. the liver not being as effective at breaking down the alcohol any longer.

Instead, it gave me this MASSIVE headache that I kept until I found my way to my house. It only went away when I fell asleep at my home.

This time around it has been consistent and some days are as heavy as a period. The blood is a little thinner than period blood, at least for my average period. No clumps. But a deep red.

Usually.

&gt;What caused my valves in my legs to break/stop working ? 

Not sure. Risk factors include a previous deep venous thrombosis, obesity, smoking, inactivity, extended periods of standing or sitting.

&gt;If they close off that vein, would the same thing that killed the valves in that vein, start killing the valves in all my veins ?

That is usually a problem in chronic venous insufficiency,

&gt; Is there any other reason than discomfort, to fix the veins ? 

Cosmetic problems

Physically, all I can see is that my balls get kind of swollen and red and very sore to the touch. But the majority of the pain is *inside* my body. It's like someone put some vice-grips up my ass and is twisting my insides.

1. I am disabled due to an unknown mental condition. Three years ago, I smoked marijuana and had something like a NDE (something to do with god). Shortly after, I dropped out of school. I admitted myself to a hospital several months later due to panic, fear, anxiety, confusion, jamais vu, depression, derealization, feelings of amnesia (memory problems), an inability to cope with my problems, and seeing no sign of improvement. My discharge diagnosis was Asperger's, anxiety, and depression. The medications made me worse, which resulted in three more hospitalizations over a two year span and different diagnoses. From what I gather, two of the inpatient diagnoses are substance induced psychotic disorder and psychotic depression.




2. Fast forward to today, I've been off all medications since March--anti-psychotics since Jan 5. I'm doing much better (my psychiatrist agrees) and haven't been hospitalized in almost a year. I'm less depressed, anxious, fearful, hysterical, ""delusional"", etc. I'm stabilized. My derealization, jamais vu, ""delusions"", fear, panic, confusion have diminished considerably, and I feel less ""amnesia"". Everything is better, but it's not enough. I still have issues. I am still disabled, living at home. 




3. Now that I'm off the medications, I feel like I have more insight into my condition. I think a lot, and I believe I could be having partial seizures, possibly in the temporal lobe. I've been drinking 2-4 energy drinks a day for eight years. And for the past five or so years, I've been having memory problems (loss), particularly with vocabulary, names of people and streets, and learning things. I've also figured out that the energy drinks seem to affect my current mental condition, but not severely as the medications. After googling some stuff, I noticed caffeine, nicotine (I smoke a pack/day), medication, and sugar affect blood sugar levels. Perhaps this has something to do with seizures. I notice the fewer energy drinks or soda I have, the better I feel by a long shot. Exercise also helps a ton. 




4. It seems sugar affects me more than caffeine.




5. I'm starting to believe I had a complex partial seizure before the NDE-like experience. I'm starting to believe I'm having simple partial seizures about every day; I notice my thoughts, emotions, and perceptions change suddenly and briefly, which screws up my day. I think it's also possible I've had complex partials too. 




6. I feel like my main debilitating symptoms are: philosophical ruminations that persist throughout the day, an inability to do daily tasks, memory and learning problems, static vision, changes in perception (especially derealization, jamais vu), frustration, an increase in autistic-like behaviors, emotional problems, and altered states of consciousness. 




7. Extra Info:


a. I have no physical symptoms of anxiety. 


b. EKG, CT scan were normal.


c. I might have had symptoms when I was younger.


d. Sometimes I see colored circles or random lines.


e. When I was younger, I used to get a black spot in the center of my eye. Ophthalmologist said my eyes were fine.


f.  Don't have diabetes.


g. I don't think it's migraines.


h. Having a beer or two helps tremendously. 


i. I have more empathy. 


j. My personality is changing. 


k. Schizophrenia was considered. However, I've never been catatonic, disorganized, paranoid, or have had significant visual or auditory hallucinations. ""Delusions"" and negative symptoms came about from medications. 


l. I've always thought I was psychotic or delusional on my own accord, but I'm questioning that now. 


m. While I was on the medications, I quit the energy drinks for three months. I did feel better, but not as well as I do now. 


n. I never lost it totally--even at my worst.  



8. My physician ordered an MRI-Without Contrast and is referring me to a Neurologist.

This occurs due to various causes and is usually diagnosed after ruling out the infection. Treatment usually involves a variety of modalities such as certain medicines, physiotherapy, light-therapy and sometimes even surgery.
A common type of non-infective prostatitis is congestive prostatitis. This is commonly characterized by semen like discharge when the person sits in squatting position such as while urinating and sometimes lower back pain. This is usually seen in sexually active men especially those who experience frequent ejaculations (such as those who frequently masturbate). In these individuals, the prostate starts functioning faster than normal, hence producing more semen. When the person somehow decreases the frequency of ejaculation, the prostate becomes congested with semen and then, when the person sits in the squatting position, his lower abdominal structures such as the bladder put pressure on the prostate, squeezing it and hence what is observed is discharge of semen like drops.
This condition settles down on its own after a few months. Sitting in a warm bathtub for 10-15 minutes daily will also reduce prostatic inflammation and provide some relief. However, if the condition persists, consultation with a urologist is recommended."" I was wondering if this is a correct assumption of what's happening?

It all started yesterday when I started to feel pain in my right arm, it was a sharp pain but it was not severe. Then I started to notice I felt weak, so I searched up my symptons online and it said I might be having a heart attack? So I decided to wait until more symptions came, and then out of nowhere I started feeling really faint and weak, And then twice I ended almost fainting. I should mention that right before I felt like fainting my heart started beating really really fast and it got worst while I thought I was going to faint. I decided to go lay down on the couch and it went away. 

Then sudenly 30 minutes later the same thing happened, my heart started to beat super fast and I felt like fainting again so I layed down again but this time right after it happened to started to drink water. So I drank about 3 glasses of water and the fainting went away.
But the random sharp pains are still there. Sometimes its on my left arm, right arm, left chest, right chest, back and also my middle finger. Its not a constant pain as in it goes away and then comes back and each time it comes back its a different area. Its also not a horrible pain to the point where it hurts, its just a small little sharp pain in the areas described. 

I also feel like I'm puke? I also feel kinda more weak then usual. And this morning I feel like theres something stuck in my throat, it almost feels like a lump when I swallow.

Another sympton that I have is shortness of breathe. I have had this for a few months now and I got a CT Scan the other week and they said that they din't find anything bad. They also gave me a blood test so I'm guessing they would of found out that I had cancer then and there.

Over time, the mosquito bite developed into a wart-like growth on the front of my knee and now constantly plagues me with pain and itchiness, especially when kneeling. I read a while ago that this particular issue was not actually a wart but a ""cell"" the body developed to help the area heal. I read that they could be removed by a doctor but would leave a scar. I don't really care about the scar, I just want this thing gone from my life.

What type of doctor should I seek to remove this bothersome growth? I am hoping it can simply be an outpatient procedure that will not require a hospital visit.

Im an 18 year old female, weighing about 183 or so. Some medical conditions I have in my family that just might be important: Mom had a tumor on the back of her brain (forgot the name of the area, dont want to bother looking for it) but taking her pills it went away and it hasn't returned in about 9 years. My dad has heart conditions (one valve is bigger than the other I think) and he's also over weight (not to the extreme either) but has lost weight. Lately odd stuff have been happening. This year while being in class (only in the mornings) my left thumb would begin to shake by itself if I bent my finger. This started happening sometime back in January maybe February or so. It was only my thumb but then my index finger started to do it too after a few times of it happening to my thumb. So now both my thumb and index do this. I graduated from high school now so im sleeping till late, so this hasn't happened any longer. It was usually always about the same time. 8am while being in my ceramics class.

My aunt has migraines and my 9 year old brother has been diagnosed with migraines as well. This is new to me because im not much of a head ache person. Would barely get any before. I wear glasses/contacts but just this monday i got my eyes checked out. My prescription has stayed the same so no problem there. Sounds tend to hurt after a while and bright light has been bothering a lot too. I usually never cared much for those things. Today something even weirder happened. While I was in the shower looking down, I started hearing the water fade a bit. I realized my vision was sort of getting weird and it was sort of like I was blacking out/fainting.

* **demografics**

age: 24

sex: male

height: 183cm

weight: 72kg

race: white

location: austria/europe

* **existing medical issues:**


*allergical asthma* but did not suffer an attack through allergie for about 10 years.

*various allergies* the most relevant are grasses and shrubs, dust mite.

*neurodermatitis**


* **History:**

i have been using various substances, in a wide variety, but mostly stimulants for the past 3 years. At first like 1 time a month but its save to say i am in with 1 time a week for at least 1 1/2 years, except for 1-2 month off a year either because of exams or other reasons.


* **symtoms which make me suspect the insufficiency:**

**Shortness of breath** - usually taking place about 12-15 h after last use of amphetamines. This symptom evolved after the first 1 1/2 years of use. It gets worse if i don't work out regularly and fades away after 1-2 days. I stopped waiting for it to go away after the first 3 times and fetched an asthma inhaler containing Salbutamol (beta2 symphatomimetica). The symptom vanishes 10 seconds after inhaling.

**weakness** - after a night of use i feel really weak. I suspect this is normal to some extend but compared to my friends i am a piece of garbage. Some of them can just stay awake one whole night and still go out, meet people and such. It is an immense effort of will for me to do so, it looks so easy watching them.

**pale face** I was always a little pale and have dark circles around my eyes more than most people, probably through neurodermatitis, my parents got above average circles around the eyes aswell.

**slower metabolism - lack of sleep** Not a symptom per se, of course its because of the amphetamines, but comparing to other people i notice i use less ampheatimes and can't sleep for a longer period of time than them. Makes me suspect slower metabolism of the compound.

**cardiac arrhythmias** fair amount of guessing here aswell. For about 1 year i get kinda anxious about my heartrate after a night of use. I can feel it beat while lying in bed, like strongly pounding and like feel the impuses it sends through my heart. Sometimes i am afraid it might just stop. Could also be a psychological issue though, i did 3 resting electrocardiographys in the past 1 year and it was always fine. i never did it after a night of use where my renals are strained most. So it might be a mix of psychological reasons and real arrhythmias.


* **typical pattern of use (night)**

start of use: 10pm

last dose: 4-5pm

time of first sleep following: 1am the following day.

As for other substances, **alcohol** is always part in lower or at times not so low doses. I try to pay attention to my **water budget** by sipping from a glass of water, typically i finish 1 glas of water (0.5l) the night. when getting home i refill a bottle and add some **magnesium**. I use a **B-Komplex with Ginseng**, **fish oil** (omega 3 fatty acids), **L-Theanine** and drink a protein shake or eat a few bites at least. The B-Komplex and the fish oil is used every day, the rest not. At times **MDMA** or **4-MMC** and **Kratom** or **Ketamine** where also part. I stopped the MDMA and 4-MMC for about half a year after i learned about the raised neurotoxicity following the combination of the compounds with speed. Ketamine was never used more than 1 - 2 times every 6 month. Kratom was used for about 3 month, 1 - 2 times every 2 weeks. Stopped that aswell for about 3 month.

As for the used dose there is a fair amount of guessing aswell, it varies a lot from event to event, and i can only guess how pure the substance is and which other compounds are in the speed. 

* **Follow up questions and plans:**

First up, i will go see a doctor for further tests on my renals anyways. This makes too much sense now that i wrote it down and structured my thoughts. 

**Which degree of insuffieciency would you expect?**
**Which implications and consequences are there?**
**Which pattern of use would be safe?**
**Anything else i can do to protect my renals and heart?**

Completely fed up with unanswered questions regarding the origins of my health condition and whether or not there may be medication or other medical attention that can be of some assistance at this point, I come to you for your opinions.  I will provide you with a timeline of symptoms and general health over my lifespan.

-Female child born, weighing just over 6 pounds.  As an infant, pediatrician shows concern that child is underweight.  At the age of 2.5, child suffers from sudden onset obesity.

-Doctors at a children's hospital (early 1980s) tell child's parents that in order for child to maintain weight, she would need to exercise three times more than the average person.  Doctors gave no further information.

-Parents worked with child, providing fun exercise and diet.  Non-related housemate was a type 1 diabetic, so junk food, especially sugar-ridden food, was very rare for the child.

-Despite dieting and exercise, child's weight continued to skyrocket.  Child neared one hundred pounds at the beginning of elementary school and reached 400 pounds when weight stabilized during the late teenage years.

-Health was remarkably good, aside from a few strange things, noticeably:  aforementioned weight issues, early acne beginning on scalp at the age of four and spreading elsewhere, and nosebleeds that marked the toddler years, but lessened and disappeared by the mid-elementary years. Doctor claimed decomposing adenoids due to antibiotics used in acne treatment; removed along with tonsils at the age of six.

-Other physical development:  Menstruation began at the age of 9.  Considered tall until growth suddenly stopped at the age of 12, ending at a height of 5'2""-5'3"".

-Cognitive and mental development:  Above average, but plagued by anxiety and depression from weight issues and the bullying that accompanied them.  Bulimia and binge eating became coping mechanisms at the ending teen years, causing further weight issues.

-Weight since the teenage years:  Continually fighting weight in the subsequent fifteen years, but never going below 350 lbs. since teens and never going over 480.  Diets could bring limited success until the previous few years, but even those result in stalls or slows in weight loss after the initial couple of weeks.

-Family health issues that might provide insight include weight issues on both sides of biological family.  Childhood obesity also prevalent.  Autoimmune disorders are also present on both sides of the biological family.

-Health around the age of 35:
F/5'2""-5'3""/464 pounds.
Asthmatic due to unrelated health problem, but exacerbated by weight.
Loss of muscle mass due to anxiety from weight and previous illness (pneumonia/ARDS), unable to walk without rapid heartbeat and accompanying pain in legs, hips, and knees.  Out of breath often.

When under medically supervised diet plan, told that only ONCE (out of many times) did Thyroid results look off (and very minutely).  Results returned normal thereafter.  Primary care doctor has done various “hormone” tests, but unaware of her exact findings or which tests she has conducted.

No typical obesity problems like diabetes, HBP, or cholesterol issues.

The bottom line is that I do have insurance and I am willing to do whatever it takes within moral boundaries in order to fix myself, but it seems almost impossible.  I have been fighting this all of my life.  My doctor seems disinterested and has acted like I was a ""lost cause"" for many years.  If there is something wrong with me that was not properly diagnosed due to medical limitations in the early 80s, I want to find out what that is and fix it.

If I have a problem with my metabolism or have further damaged what metabolism I did have, I obviously want to fix that, as well.

I have lost a small amount of weight on a ketogenic diet, being extremely vigilant about record keeping, water intake, etc.  If this diet does not work, I will consider bariatric surgery, but if there is something wrong with me that inhibits weight loss, I do not want to have a somewhat risky surgery and not see results.

I know that Reddit is a fairly intolerant community for weight related issues, but my health regarding this topic has been medically documented since my earliest childhood.  I am eager to find someone who may be able to give me a couple of leads.  I know that genetic issues are a possibility, but I am unsure what to look for or what treatments might be available.  I believe that I would feel much more confident when confronting my physician with evidence, rather than vague concern and distress because that has not worked for me thus far.

TL;DR – Sudden, extreme onset childhood obesity leading into further weight problems as an adult.  Many doctor visits as a child in the early 1980s revealed nothing other than a metabolism in which it would take me “three times as much exercise as the average person” in order to maintain my weight.  No cognitive issues or physical deformities that accompany other obesity syndromes.  Looking for information about possible genetic issues, disorders, etc.  – ANYTHING.  Finding it difficult to lose weight with any method at this time.

Called the doctor to asses my options financially and she was very helpful and told me that its state law, that as long as you pay  7.20$ a month its technically a payment and wont slaughter your credit or anything (I'm young and I have no idea about this shit, i'm just going to throw what money I can at them till I pay it off) They gave me the advice to drink baking soda and water, but LOTS OF WATER. I did so and my condition improved with in hours, (Ie, no more pain, no more blood, even clear urine with no strange smell) But I still plan to go to my appointment.

UK female here, 25 years old + clinically obese.

I've recently started attending an obesity clinic for help with losing weight.  After my first appointment, they ran my bloods and I was told over the phone that I have an under-active thyroid function, and that I should book an appointment with my GP to confirm and start medication.  They sent my blood results over to him to make sure he had the information they'd found.

I booked the GP appointment on request and spent some time researching on the internet (not the best idea, I know, but it gave me a rough idea of symptoms).  I seemed to fit the symptoms given by the NHS website fairly well - depression, dry skin, weight gain, tiredness, muscle aches, etc.

Today I attended the appointment in the hopes that I could start treatment ASAP.  I was told that my thyroid function is normal, if not over-active.  I was pretty stunned and didn't really know how to react, so I didn't ask many questions.

He showed me the blood results - I apologise that I can't provide any more specific information, but my mind was a bit fuzzy at the time.  He showed me two different parts of the results, one was normal and one was slightly below normal (0.3 when the normal range was, I think, 0.35-0.5).  His reasoning was that the one below normal wasn't having to work as hard to make my thyroid work properly, so technically it was over-active, not under-active.

I'm going back to the obesity clinic later this week and I will try to clear things up with them, but in the mean time if anyone can shed some light on this situation I'd be much appreciative.

If you need me to provide any more information, I'll gladly do so, but I figured that I've provided enough info for this particular issue.

-------------------------------

Since last night, I've noticed a numbness in my left front thigh. I was sitting with my legs crossed for some time and felt them asleep. Naturally, I changed positions and felt the blood circulate back to normal as it usually does. However, I noticed this particular part of my body was still asleep, or so I thought. I tried walking around, jogging in place, and even had a hot shower. Nothing worked.

At that point, I just went to bed, hoping it would possibly go away the next day. It has not. The numbness starts at just below waist level and ends at the kneecap. No other area on my body is numb, not even the back or sides of said thigh. 

Fortunately, I can still move my leg around like normal. I have no trouble standing, walking, or anything involving physical activity requiring leg movement. Heck, I can even still hop on only that leg with no problems.

I am asking because I had my first real nosebleed last night and started getting some other symptoms that required the urgent care nurse to transfer me to 911.  After they arrived they took my BP which was 190/110.  They then brought me to the hospital where we tried to stop the nose bleed.  The paramedics seemed to think the nosebleed was a symptom of the BP but some of the doctors felt the BP could be a result of the Nosebleed.  About 4 hours after admittance and maybe 20 minutes after taking a BP medication it mostly stopped and I was discharged with a bloody nose and directions to follow up in a day or two.  The main ER doctor felt the BP medication was unnecessary and was skeptical that it played a role in the slowing down but rather the 2 rounds Afrin soaked gauze was more likely the case.
I made an appt for 2 days later but today still felt out of it and was told to take my BP again which again resulted in a 177/109 and have had blood going down my throat most of the day but in much less quantities.  
I guess a long story short, is the nosebleed a symptom of the BP in most instances or the other way around?  If the BP is the root of the nose bleed, then also what could cause a sudden increase in BP for a normally healthy male in his early 30's.  I feel like if I understood this a bit more the anxiety of it all would be less but the information online seems all over the board.  Also if the nosebleed is the symptom of the BP, why?  Why not eyes, or ears, or something else?

I recently quit my job, was extremely stressful, missed my period (NOT pregnant, am sexless....), been having diarrhea lots, and been getting yelled at often. I have some anxiety/nervousness going on lately and I get minor head rushes in the back of my head while sleeping, but nothing else major.

These dots seem to have no specific trigger. They occur most often while I am trying to sleep (doesn't matter which position either) and they occur 10-20 times throughout the day. They almost never happen while I am looking at the TV/Computer/Phone screen. At first I thought it was a lighting issue, but it happens while I look at the sky during the day.

Darkness makes the dark spots far more obvious, but daylight makes the light spots more obvious. 

My mom thinks it's stress/anxiety, but I'm worried that there's pressure in my optic nerves or brain. My family has NO history of brain related issues, just bad knees.

Minor Details: 

- Wisdom teeth are just coming in, a little sore.

- Slight insomnia.

- Slight anxiety.

- Missed period.

- Asperger's.

- Possible has blood sugar issues, because I'm overweight and I'm a fucking pig that doesn't always eat right.

- Issue has been going on for almsot a month now, not getting better nor worse in any way.

[I currently do not have health insurance; going to the dermatologist is slightly out of my budget] I apologize for the poor grammar, formatting, and the pictures/condition of my feet.

This all started around late April. I was wearing a pair of sperries one day, barefooted, and noticed there was an agitation and soreness coming from the outer edge of my pinky toe. I thought nothing of it, because I thought it was just the discomfort of  wearing boat shoes without socks. (this is where I think the cut/sore was infected)

Furthermore, I play a lot of basketball. I play about 2-3 hours, 4 days a week. So around early May, I continue to have this unusual discomfort on my toe. Thus I check it out and see this blister-looking-thing on the outside edge of my right pinky toe. Of course, I just thought it was an ordinary blister. 
A few weeks go by, and the ""blister"" gets covered in callus, and the unusual throbbing pain, and discomfort on my foot and toes gets more and more acute. Foolishly, I continued to think that it was just one really bad blister. [](http://imgur.com/a/07lbw#7)
A few days ago, I brought this up with some of my teammates after a basketball practice. I couldn't take the pain anymore and showed them my toe. They told me it looked like a wart. I was actually is disbelief/shock. I was ignorant and did not know anything about warts besides the STI. This was a few days ago.
I have already bought some, ""Compound W Fast-acting-gel"", cut off the callus, picked out the black dots under the callus, and applied the gel for a few days now.

Antigens are proteins that are present on the surface of body cells, in this case red blood cells. Antibodies bind to specific antigens and destroys the cell the antigen is on, and in case of antibodies that bind to red blood cells you have a risk of hemolysis (thats the medical term for the breakdown of blood). 

Your wife has kell antibodies, which means she was once transfused with blood that had kell antigen on the surface. She herself does not have the kell antigen, because someone with kell antigen does not produces anti-kell antibodies. That would be very silly, because then her body would attack her own blood cells.
If you don't have kell antigen on your red blood cells then the baby is safe because your wifes antigens will not attack the babies blood cells.

If however you are positive for kell antigen then there is a small chance that your wife will produces antibodies against the blood cells of your baby (if the baby inherits your kell antigen). If that is the case, the baby will need treatment against hemolytic anemia (anemia caused by the breakdown of blood).

I hope this makes things more clear for you and your wife. And congratulations on becoming a parent!",t3_2af39k,3.0,AskDocs,murpahurp,ciuf5jc,1405082263,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2af39k

His symptoms do line up with the same month he went down on me. The symptoms being extreme nausea and gagging 5+ times a day. He also periodically felt a lump in his throat, which has completely disappeared prior to treatment. The treatment worked and he's down to what he considers ""normal gagging"".

I'm very clean, which leads me to wonder if he's right about this. I'm just not so sure because even before February he would gag at least once a day for any number of reasons, e.g. Entering a sudden temperature change, hot to cold or vice versa and brushing his teeth, plus some other triggers I can provide in the comments if there's further interest. 

He's a bit of a clean freak, but before getting married two years ago, he didn't have hand soap in the apartment's shared bathroom. The research I've done ties not washing hands frequently with contracting H. Pylori and so I wonder how long this bacteria can stay dormant or weak and whether it tends to suddenly flare up after a long period of incubation.

I often wake up earlier than I’d like, and I can never nap. I’ll be the only one on a red eye flight who’s not able to sleep on an airplane. 

Sometimes a car alarm will wake me up at 6am. Or I’ll just spontaneously wake up at 7:30. Can I get back to sleep? Nope! Despite months of progressive muscle relaxation, I still can’t take naps! 

Usually waking up too early is related to depression. But even with anti-depressants, talk therapy, light therapy, nothing seems to do the trick! 

I heard about doxepin at 10mg. That does seem to help me not wake up so early. But then I have this sense of brain fog all day.  

All my friends trust me to drive at night because I’d have to be without sleep for about 2-3 days before I could fall asleep in a car. But I’d like to be able to nap! Meditation and relaxation techniques don’t seem to do anything. 

Who should I talk to about this? Maybe it’s something neurological? I had a sleep study done about 7 years ago and they didn’t find anything. What sort of specialist should I talk to? In the past 10 years, I've only been able to take a nap maybe 3 times!

Both toenails and fingernails are this weird white-purple but much closer to white. its different from the snow-white spots I usually have in my fingernails and all my nails are this color. Maybe two nails on my fingers have a slight line of normal pink right under the part of the nail you cut. Also its hard to tell on my toes, but my fingernails have these thin vertical things that look like cracks but aren't. Maybe ridges, and they are not crooked at all, and go down the whole nail. 



On both my big toes there are about 3 black or very dark brown lines that are thin and they go across the nail horizontally. they are curved. Underneath my nail is the same color as the rest of my nails. 


The only other things I can think of is that I keep switching from being hot enough to almost sweat to being cold enough I need a blanket even though the temperature in my house stays at 76 degrees F. I haven't been out of the house much since I hurt my ankle (i think its sprained but not sure) and can't drive (plus the crutches are too heavy for me to use for long). I am tired and don't have much energy and as a result I'm kinda apathetic. At the same time, even though  I'm tired I am having trouble sleeping. I stayed up for absolutely no reason other than I couldn't go to sleep (no exam or anything). Otherwise I can't sleep for more than 3-4 hours, although I get the occasional 6. 


I also have barely any appetite. This is with the depo shot that my ob gyn said causes an increase in appetite. Instead of gaining weight I've lost some--and I am thin to begin with. What appetite seems to be left is for sugar and carbs which I never used to crave this much. Part of that may be that I don't have the energy to cook even a simple meal like I used to do. And despite switching to the depo from my pill, I am still bleeding (and have been for 4 months straight) heavy enough to be a normal girl's relatively light period.

I haven't read too many long term studies on people with this kind of thing, and while mine is mild I can feel myself getting weaker with age (that might just be age though).

Another thing that worries me is my dad was diagnosed with dermamyotimitus (spelling error there) and basically the muscle in there was weak, so I'm nervous that if not exercised right I'm going to end up choking on food, he spent 2 years in the hospital before anyone could finally figure out what was actually wrong. 

So basically what I'm asking is, do I have any room to worry about this? I'm an otherwise healthy 33 year old (I only smoke) but like I said the muscle weakness is getting worse I know it and I can feel it.

White.


My main complaints are abdominal pain, daily bouts of nausea, extreme fatigue, a significant amount of mucus in my stool, lower back pain, and extreme constipation. This past November, I went to a G.I. doctor who performed an endoscopy and a colonoscopy. What they found was an inflamed esophagus, inflamed bowels, and a large amount of internal hemorrhoids. He prescribed Omeprazole for the acid reflux and removed the hemorrhoids via banding (said there were about 7 or 8). They have since returned with a vengeance. Two weeks ago, I went for a HIDA scan because my physician was suspecting a non-functioning gallbladder and/or problems with my liver. A few days later she informed me that everything came back normally.


Mind you, I have been having ""stomach"" issues my whole life. From kindergarten to the 8th grade I endured the wrath of a ""mystery disease"", which caused me to wake up in the early hours of the morning violently ill and projectile vomiting (despite an empty stomach). This would last about 8 hours and then I would be completely fine. But those hours that I was sick were excruciating; I would have to sleep on the bathroom floor next to the toilet because the pain was simply too much to bear for my tiny little body. The taste of stomach bile became a part of my everyday life. I went to endless specialists back then, who also performed a colonoscopy, endoscopy, X-rays, CT scans, and barium swallows. The only conclusion anyone could come to was severe acid reflux --but no cause was ever determined.


I am now 22 and some of these terrible symptoms have returned for the first time in 10 years. Not only am I having the upper-GI issues, but horrible problems with my bowels. This has been going on for the past 2 years. Every time I urinate, I poop. I am constantly pooping; I probably spend roughly an hour a day (altogether) sitting on the toilet pooping. However, it's almost always unsatisfying. Sometimes I go a little, sometimes I go a LOT. Usually I don't even know I have to go until I go to wipe after a pee, touch my anus with toilet paper, and get the SUDDEN urge to poop. So I strain until it comes out. And then I find myself in the same position a few hours later. It varies from hard, to soft, to very thin and ""snake-like""...it almost ALWAYS has mucus in it. Usually dark, very foul-smelling, and overall simply not ""normal stool"". This daily struggle is almost *always* accompanied with nausea, abdominal pain, and lower back pain. But like I said, sometimes I can poop a LOT, think I am done for the day, and then find myself pooping out twice that amount later in the day. My stomach is always distended; although I am tall and slender, I often appear pregnant because of my large belly. I feel like someone could just stick a pin in me and I'll pop like a balloon!


Other (unrelated) symptoms: daily tonsil stones, acne, low motivation


I went in for a CT scan on Tuesday and the nurse just called me this morning to let me know the results. She said that I have a bladder infection, an ovarian cyst on my left ovary, colitis, and (her exact words) ""you are FULL of poop! Like absolutely stuffed with poo."" -_- 

My first question is...are any of these issues related to one another? My second question is, how long is it possible to have a bladder infection for? I had NO idea this was going on!
My third question is...HOW ON EARTH do I get all of this poop out of me? I am absolutely desperate! I am sick of exLax (clearly it doesn't do it for me,) and I assumed since I eat so healthily (vegetarian diet; mostly fresh &amp; raw fruits and vegetables,) that there's no way it's all getting backed up inside of me! I even took a huge poop before the CT scan! Is there any kind of natural cleanse that is recommended to assist with constipation? Obviously my stomach and bowels are VERY sensitive...so I am looking for something with only natural ingredients that are beneficial for softening and releasing the poop out of me.
My fourth question is...should I be concerned about the ovarian cyst?


I appreciate ANY bit of advice from you reddit docs! :) Clearly I have been through a lot throughout my 22 years of existence and am really just ready for an answer (or miracle) so I can move on with my life.

However, I am concerned.

I just had an ultrasound done a week before and the results all came back 'normal'. Why didn't they detect it on the ultrasound? I then had a HIDA scan done to rule out problems with my gallbladder and liver. Again, negative. Then, two days ago I had a CT performed on my abdomen and pelvis. I just received the news that I have an ovarian cyst and I am worried that it is cancer. The next step is to have a transvaginal ultrasound done. What will this show? Why can't my doctor just remove the cyst? Do ANY of these tests show cancer, or does a biopsy have to be performed?

The only reason that I am worried is because of my longstanding, progressive symptoms that have been occurring over the past 3 years. These include excruciatingly heavy periods (accompanied with debilitating cramps, enormous blood clots, pain, nausea, and occasional vomiting); 'mystery' stomach/GI problems (please see my other post for more details)-eventually diagnosed as IBS; heartburn; and lower back pain that has moved down my left leg.

They don't always assess ovaries with abdominal ultrasound.

If the cyst is benign, there is no need to remove it

&gt;Do ANY of these tests show cancer, or does a biopsy have to be performed?

A transvaginal ultrasound is quite reliable, especially when combined with patient characteristics and (if needed) laboratory values. Biopsies are not performed on ovarian masses: they would need to be removed with surgery.

&gt;Should I be concerned, or are these normal symptoms that are associated with benign cysts?

No, benign ovarian cyst usually don't cause symptoms. This cyst is probably an incidental finding.

&gt;I've had a gyno exam and pap smear done within the past year...why wasn't this something seen then?

Gynaecological exams are unreliable in detecting ovarian masses (until they are very large). Pap smears screen for cervical carcinoma, they don't have anything to do with your ovaries.",t3_2aytj4,2.0,AskDocs,Ulsenius,cj07nuv,1405624118,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2aytj4

CT scan, MRI, bloodwork, and EKG all came back fine. I don't have MS, a brain tumor, or any prior stroke damage. I don't have headaches, so migraine has also tentatively been ruled out. Next up is an ultrasound of my neck and heart.

I do have some family history of stokes/heart attacks. I have no other health issues and this has never happened before. 

My question is sort of more about my doctors then medical advice. My gyn says that if my neurologist is calling it a mini-stroke (which he is), then I cannot be on hormonal birth control ever again. But, my neurologist says that the danger of getting pregnant outweighs the danger of having another stroke so I don't need to go off of it. I feel like the gyn would know, but I'm also kind of looking for excuses to stay on the bc, which I love. I don't want to stop it for no reason. Who...should I believe? 

I like my neurologist and he seems to be taking this seriously (much more seriously than the ER did), but is it weird that he's not concerned about the birth control possibly causing the stroke? He's also told me there's no reason to think it will happen again, which...well, it doesn't match what I've googled up on the subject of mini-strokes.

I have a nevus on my lower back that has been there for about 5 years (can't really remember). I had an appointment with my family doctor the other day and I showed it to her. I didn't see anything wrong with it before, but I've noticed it grew a bit, so that's why I decided to show it now (and also, I'm doing a masters in oncology, so I kind of became more aware of the situation, although I'm not a doctor). My doctor didn't think it would be anything major (i.e. melanoma), but she wanted to remove it and send it to pathology (which I will be doing this saturday).
Is is about 4x4mm and in the middle it has a sort of indentation with darker pigmentation.

Do you have any other symptoms (especially ones that come in episodes?) Can you describe the headache? Any behavioural or learning difficulties?

One would really need to read the EEG report to say something useful. Did they try to provoke seizures in any way during the EEG (hyperventilation, light flashes, sleep deprivation)? But, as you say you didn't have any seizures to your knowledge, I wouldn't worry about it. . You don't have epilepsy (you would need 2 unprovoked seizures to be diagnosed with epilepsy).

I found an article (1) mentioning that up to 6,6% of healthy volunteers show interictal (not during a seizure) epileptic activity on an EEG. The seizure risk that these patients is not clearly known, but I read that if they have seizures, they are more often provoked (after a stroke, head trauma, metabolic abnormalities). 

So, it may be the case that you're more at risk to have a seizure (especially when something happens like head trauma) compared to the general population. If this warrant the use if anti-epileptic drugs: not sure. I would discuss this with a neurologist specialised in epilepsy. 

You mention SUDEP; sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. Epilepsy patients with the most seizure activity are most at risk for this. As you didn't have any seizures, I don't think you have to worry about that

Add to this that these lab workers at the center were anything but professional. Gold teeth, cursing, unclean lab rooms, etc. I know I probably shouldn't have done testing there but I've never encountered a medical facility like this in the US, I was just confused and followed directions, so it is partly on me.  In addition, one of the patients there for bloodwork that night was an AIDS patient. (I overheard them discussing) and she tested him right before me.

TL; DR. Left side of body becomes numb and painful during sleep.  Is it serious? 


Once every month or so when I am sleeping I wake up with horrible pain in my left abdomen or other parts of the left side of my body.  I didn't think much of it until this morning.  I had just fallen asleep but I remained conscious. I was dreaming a little bit, but I felt my body beginning to go into a deeper sleep.  As I was doing so, the entire left side of my body started becoming numb and became extremely painful and then I realized I get the same feeling whenever my arm or leg falls asleep.  I was sleeping on my right side like I normally do. I have had experiences like this for several years now, but never when awake.  Is it a sign of something serious?

There was something unusually hard at the bottom of it. I often find things lodged in there (lint, etc.) that I pull out. But this wouldn't come out. It didn't hurt, so I didn't think it was a scab, but I couldn't tell. I've been paranoid about ticks (it's tick season), and anyhow I fell asleep while doing this and didn't remember until the next day when my navel was full of this gooey yellow substance and scabs--also a red sore.

I can't visualize most of my navel due to being overweight. But I wiped it out with an alcohol swab and then put neosporin in it. It didn't seem  to help.

So the next day I used an alcohol swab and clotrimazole cream. I hadn't thought about it until just now because it's had no pain. I was in the bathroom and happened to see visible crusting coming out of it. I was out of alcohol swabs so I used a preparation H wipe (witch hazel) to clean it out. It wasn't painful but it still seems like there are sores and a lot of yellow scabs came out again.

I am unsure if this is bacterial or fungal, but I again put the clotrimazole back on it just now.

I have had these navel infections quite frequently over the last couple of years, perhaps due to hair there. I'm hoping it's not from urachal cancer, which I just read it could be.

Usually I'll randomly try neosporin or clotrimazole and it gets better either way. I'm not sure what's going on this time.

I know the advice is to go to the doctor, and I actually did! I went to urgent care and got there at 755 PM. They close at 8. They locked the doors and told me they wouldn't let me in through the glass  door.

So, I can go back, I guess, but I feel like if I can maybe identify whether it's more likely fungal or bacterial I can have a better chance at treating it in the mean time.

Belly buttons are not ment to be played with. The skin is very very fragile and it tears easily, as you experienced. What you have is just a wound, it's not infected. It can ooze a little (the little yellow dried up specks) but thats just fluid from the wound. Stop picking and let it heal on its own. 

By the way: issues like these are not really something for urgent care or an ER. Especially at night. These are daytime problems for GP's.

There is a tube that goes from your inner ear to your mouth. That allows pressure to equalize (which is why when you dive you pinch your nose and bow hard - it forces air into that tube). When you get sick the cells that line that tube get inflamed and swell up, pinching it off. This traps the air in your inner ear and will end up making the pressure in the middle ear lower than atmospheric pressure. This makes it harder for your ear drum to vibrate because the pressure differential is dampening the effect of sound waves. That's why everything sounds muffled. 

It is just a question of that tube opening up again, which will require at least some of the inflammation to go down. One trick you can try is to take your fingers and put them just under your ear and the backside of your jaw and press forward as you making a yawning motion with your jaw. Sometimes that can stretch out the tube, making the cells lining it lay flatter, and possibly open it up again. 

However, the problem will likely return until the inflammation goes down enough so that the tube stays open all the time. This is because the air that is in there will be trapped and then the oxygen that is in it will slowly be absorbed by the tissues, leading to a drop in pressure and the same muffled sounds again. If the yawm/jaw push maneuver worked you can try it again to get temporary relief.

Sometimes taking a decongestant like pseudephedrine will help since that will decrease the swelling in that tube (as well as your nose and sinuses, hence the decongestant). But it will also just pass on its own.",t3_2c4sfy,2.0,AskDocs,nybgrus,cjbx09q,1406721720,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2c4sfy

I've been having this rasping cough for about 6 - 9 months.

Nothing but the cough, I don't have a runny nose, sore eyes or headaches. Just the cough.

I don't cough up anything, it's a dry cough, if that makes sense. 

I never thought to much of it because it would only show shortly after muscle training.

When I finish a exercise, 4 sets of 10, I often have to take a short break because of the coughing.

The severity of the coughs depends on the exercise I happened to be doing.

It's started to happen during exercises and it's affecting my workout because I'll be forced to stop mid exercise.

Somebody approached me in the gym and told me to have it checked out.

I'm 21 years of age, 6""1 ( 183 - 185cm ), 172 pounds ( About 78 kg ), Caucasian male.

I visit the gym about 5 times a week and have been doing this for about a year.

I don't take any medication, have no allergies and have never in my life been to the hospital.

I used to drink protein shakes and what not, but I stopped drinking those a few months back.

Never taken anything like creatine or anything more severe.

I don't drink and haven't smoked a cigarette in my life. 

Although my parents are both heavy smokers and have been for as long as I can remember.

I do intend to have it checked out eventually, I've got health insurance.
