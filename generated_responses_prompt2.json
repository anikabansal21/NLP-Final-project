    "1i7s0u": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nI'm glad you're planning to see your doctor on Monday, as this situation requires prompt medical attention. Based on your symptoms, I'm concerned about a possible infection or severe inflammatory reaction at the injection site.\n\nThe presence of swelling, redness, warmth, and muscle spasms around the injection site and knee area suggests a significant local reaction. The fact that you've been using a large volume of testosterone (4ml) with a high concentration (500mg/ml) and a relatively small needle (25g) may have contributed to the issue.\n\nThe addition of 3% Benzyl Alcohol as a preservative is not uncommon, but it's possible that you may have had an adverse reaction to it. The filtering process through a 0.22nm nylon filter is also a standard practice, but it's not a guarantee against contamination or reaction.\n\nGiven your symptoms, I would consider the following possibilities:\n\n1. **Infection**: Although you don't have a fever, the presence of redness, warmth, and swelling at the injection site could indicate a localized infection. Your doctor may need to perform a thorough examination, possibly with imaging studies (e.g., ultrasound or MRI), to rule out an abscess or other complications.\n2. **Severe inflammatory reaction**: The muscle spasms, swelling, and pain you're experiencing could be due to a severe inflammatory response to the testosterone or the preservative.\n3. **Nerve damage**: The location of the injection site, near the quadriceps, raises concerns about potential nerve damage. The muscle spasms and pain you're experiencing could be related to nerve irritation or damage.\n\nIt's essential to have your doctor evaluate you in person, as they will need to assess the injection site, check for any signs of infection or nerve damage, and possibly order imaging studies or labs to rule out other complications.\n\nIn the meantime, I would recommend the following:\n\n* Continue to keep the affected leg elevated and avoid putting weight on it.\n* Apply ice to the injection site to help reduce swelling and pain.\n* Avoid taking any more ibuprofen, as it may not be effective, and your doctor may prescribe alternative pain management options.\n* Make sure to discuss your medication history, including the use of anabolic steroids and peptides, with your doctor, as this information is crucial for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\nPlease keep us updated on your doctor's visit and any subsequent diagnosis or treatment. Remember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your health, especially when using performance-enhancing substances.",
    "1i7qst": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nI can sense your concern for your mother's friend, and I'm happy to help shed some light on his situation. As a physician, I must emphasize that it's great that he's been seeing doctors and undergoing tests, but it's also important to consider that there might be other underlying conditions that need to be explored.\n\nThe symptoms you've described, such as shortness of breath, exhaustion, and abnormal breathing patterns, can be indicative of various conditions, including but not limited to:\n\n1. **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)**: Although he's not a heavy smoker, COPD can still be a possibility, especially if he's had a history of smoking. The fact that his lung capacity is smaller suggests that there might be some degree of lung damage.\n2. **Pulmonary Hypertension**: This condition can cause shortness of breath, fatigue, and exercise intolerance, even at rest.\n3. **Heart Failure**: Reduced lung capacity and shortness of breath can be symptoms of heart failure, especially if he has a history of high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, or other cardiac conditions.\n4. **Interstitial Lung Disease**: This is a broad category of conditions that affect the lung tissue, leading to scarring and reduced lung function.\n5. **Anemia or other hematological disorders**: These can cause shortness of breath, fatigue, and exercise intolerance.\n\nRegarding his inhaler, it's possible that it's not effective because it's not addressing the underlying condition. Asthma inhalers are designed to treat bronchospasm and inflammation, but if his condition is not asthma-related, the inhaler might not be providing adequate relief.\n\nAs for medications, there are several options that can help with shortness of breath, depending on the underlying condition. These might include:\n\n1. **Oxygen therapy**: If his oxygen levels are low, supplemental oxygen can help alleviate shortness of breath.\n2. **Phosphodiesterase inhibitors**: These medications can help improve lung function and reduce shortness of breath in conditions like pulmonary hypertension.\n3. **Beta-blockers**: In some cases, beta-blockers can help reduce symptoms of shortness of breath and improve exercise tolerance.\n4. **Pulmonary rehabilitation**: This is a comprehensive program that includes exercise, education, and behavioral changes to help improve lung function and overall health.\n\nTo progressively increase his lung capacity, I would recommend the following:\n\n1. **Pulmonary rehabilitation**: As mentioned earlier, this program can help improve lung function and overall health.\n2. **Exercise training**: Gentle exercises like walking, yoga, or tai chi can help improve cardiovascular fitness and increase lung capacity.\n3. **Breathing exercises**: Techniques like diaphragmatic breathing, pursed-lip breathing, or box breathing can help improve lung function and reduce shortness of breath.\n4. **Smoking cessation**: Although he's not a heavy smoker, quitting smoking altogether can help improve lung function and reduce the risk of further lung damage.\n\nI would strongly encourage him to seek a second opinion from a pulmonologist or a cardiologist to rule out any underlying conditions that might be contributing to his symptoms. Additionally, a comprehensive pulmonary function test (PFT) can help assess his lung function and guide further treatment.\n\nPlease keep in mind that this is not a substitute for a professional medical consultation, and I'm only providing general information based on the symptoms you've described. I hope this helps, and I wish him the best in his journey to improved health.",
    "1i7hzo": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nI'd like to offer some advice on your situation. First, I must commend you on being proactive about your health and seeking medical attention for your symptoms. It's great that you've already had some tests done to rule out common infections and ulcerative colitis.\n\nGiven your symptoms, a colonoscopy is a reasonable next step to investigate potential inflammation or other underlying conditions. While it's understandable that you're considering the cost and waiting until you return to the US, I would caution against delaying the procedure too long.\n\nAs you've mentioned, bowel cancer can occur in younger individuals, and it's essential to rule out this possibility. Although your symptoms have improved slightly with dietary changes, it's crucial to remember that some conditions, like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or even cancer, can have a waxing and waning course.\n\nThe fact that you've had multiple courses of antibiotics in the past year is also relevant, as this can disrupt the gut microbiome and potentially contribute to your symptoms. Your history of severe food allergies is also noteworthy, as some research suggests a possible link between food allergies and increased risk of IBD.\n\nWhile it's unlikely that you have a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention, I would recommend against foregoing the colonoscopy altogether. If you decide to wait until December, I suggest you continue to monitor your symptoms closely and seek medical attention if you experience any worsening or new symptoms, such as:\n\n* Increased rectal bleeding\n* Abdominal pain that worsens or becomes constant\n* Unexplained weight loss\n* Fever or chills\n\nIn the meantime, you may want to consider discussing the following with your bowel specialist:\n\n* A stool test for calprotectin or lactoferrin to check for inflammation\n* A trial of a different diet, such as a low FODMAP diet, to see if it improves your symptoms\n* A review of your antibiotic use and potential alternatives for future infections\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your health. If you're concerned about the cost, you may want to explore options for financial assistance or discuss a payment plan with the healthcare provider in New Zealand.\n\nPlease keep in mind that this is not a substitute for in-person medical advice, and you should continue to follow up with your bowel specialist for personalized guidance.\n\n**Edit:** I've seen some comments suggesting that you may be able to negotiate the cost of the colonoscopy or explore other options for reducing the expense. I would encourage you to discuss this with your healthcare provider or a patient advocate to see if there are any possibilities for reducing the financial burden.",
    "1iawxh": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nI feel for you, OP. 8 years is a long time to deal with Acne Rosacea, and I can understand how it affects your social life. As a dermatologist, I've seen many patients with similar struggles. While there's no permanent \"cure\" for Rosacea, there are effective treatments that can help manage symptoms.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you've tried various moisturizing creams and oils, but it's likely that you need a more targeted approach. I recommend consulting a dermatologist (if you haven't already) to get a proper diagnosis and discuss treatment options.\n\nIn my experience, a combination of topical and oral medications can be effective in reducing symptoms. For example, metronidazole or azelaic acid creams/gels can help reduce inflammation and kill bacteria that exacerbate Rosacea. Oral antibiotics like doxycycline or minocycline can also be prescribed for more severe cases.\n\nAdditionally, lifestyle changes can make a big difference. Avoiding triggers like spicy food, alcohol, and extreme temperatures can help reduce flare-ups. Using gentle, fragrance-free skincare products and protecting your skin from the sun (UV rays can trigger Rosacea) are also essential.\n\nI've also seen success with laser treatments, such as pulsed dye laser or intense pulsed light (IPL), which can help reduce redness and visible blood vessels.\n\nIt's worth noting that Rosacea is a chronic condition, and it may take some trial and error to find the right treatment combination that works for you. But with the right approach, you can definitely reduce the frequency and severity of flare-ups.\n\nDon't lose hope, OP! There are many effective treatments available, and with the right guidance, you can take control of your Rosacea. I encourage you to consult a dermatologist and work together to find a treatment plan that suits your needs.\n\n**Edit:** I'd like to add that there are also some promising new treatments on the horizon, such as topical ivermectin and bromfenac, which have shown efficacy in reducing Rosacea symptoms. However, these may not be available everywhere, and it's best to discuss these options with a dermatologist.",
    "1i9v7i": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nI'm glad to hear that you're feeling a bit better today. I'll try to provide some insight into what might have happened. \n\nFirstly, your symptoms - dizziness, high blood pressure, rapid heart rate, and tingling in your hands - are quite concerning and warrant a thorough investigation, which it seems you've had. The fact that your tests (bloodwork, urine, ECG, and chest X-ray) came back normal is reassuring, but it doesn't necessarily mean that there's nothing to worry about.\n\nGiven your history of smoking and drinking, it's possible that you might have experienced a vasovagal episode, which can be triggered by stress, anxiety, or even a sudden change in position. These episodes can cause a rapid heart rate, high blood pressure, and dizziness, which seems to fit with what you experienced.\n\nAnother possibility is that you might have had a panic attack, which can also cause similar symptoms. Anxiety can indeed play a significant role in triggering these episodes, and it's possible that your anxiety might have contributed to what happened.\n\nIt's also worth considering other potential causes, such as dehydration, low blood sugar, or even a cardiac issue that didn't show up on your initial tests. However, without more information, it's difficult to say for certain.\n\nI would recommend following up with your primary care physician or a cardiologist to discuss your symptoms and test results in more detail. They may want to run some additional tests or monitor you for a bit to see if you experience any more episodes.\n\nIn the meantime, make sure to stay hydrated, get plenty of rest, and try to manage your stress and anxiety levels. If you experience any more symptoms or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to your doctor or seek emergency care if necessary.\n\n**Edit:** I'll add that it's not uncommon for people to experience a bit of weakness and lightheadedness after an episode like this, so it's possible that you're just feeling a bit drained. However, if your symptoms persist or worsen, be sure to seek medical attention.",
    "1i99v4": "**Verified Physician here (Orthodontist)**\n\nI took a look at the image your wife sent, and I think I can put your minds at ease. The little pointed tip you're referring to is likely a normal anatomical variation called a \"cusp of Carabelli\" or a \"tubercle of Carabelli\". It's a small, pointed projection that can be found on the surface of some teeth, usually the maxillary first molars (which appears to be the tooth in the picture).\n\nThis cusp is a benign structure and is not a nerve. It's just an extra little bump on the tooth that can sometimes be more pronounced in certain individuals. I've seen this many times in my practice, and it's not a cause for concern.\n\nThat being said, it's always great that your wife is being proactive and scheduling a dentist appointment for your daughter. A dental check-up is always a good idea, especially if your daughter hasn't had one recently. The dentist can take a closer look and confirm that everything is okay.\n\nThanks for sharing, and I'm glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns!",
    "1idgsp": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nI've read through your post and I must say, it's quite concerning. While it's great that you're taking this incident seriously, I have to advise you that self-diagnosis via WebMD is not the best approach.\n\nDehydration is a possibility, but it's unlikely to be the sole cause of such a sudden and severe episode, especially given your description of your urine output. Alcohol can indeed cause dehydration, but it usually takes longer to develop and is often accompanied by other symptoms like headache, fatigue, and dry mouth.\n\nThere are several other potential explanations for your episode, including:\n\n1. **Vasovagal syncope**: This is a common cause of fainting, especially in young adults. It's often triggered by stress, pain, or certain medications, but can also be caused by dehydration, low blood sugar, or other factors.\n2. **Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)**: This is a condition characterized by a rapid heart rate and other symptoms that occur upon standing. It's more common in young adults and can be triggered by dehydration, alcohol, or other factors.\n3. **Cardiac issues**: Although you're young and athletic, it's possible that you may have an underlying cardiac condition, such as a heart arrhythmia or cardiomyopathy, that could be contributing to your symptoms.\n\nI strongly advise you to schedule an appointment with your primary care physician to discuss this incident further. They will likely perform a physical exam, take a detailed medical history, and may order some tests (e.g., ECG, blood work) to rule out any underlying conditions.\n\nIn the meantime, make sure to stay hydrated, avoid excessive alcohol consumption, and be mindful of any other symptoms that may develop.\n\n**Please don't self-diagnose or try to brush this off as a one-time incident**. It's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your health.\n\nEdit: I'll add that MS (multiple sclerosis) is highly unlikely to be the cause of your symptoms, given the acute and transient nature of your episode. However, it's still important to consult with a physician to rule out any other potential causes.",
    "1icpya": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nI'd be happy to help you out. Without being able to physically examine the bump, it's difficult to provide a definitive diagnosis. However, based on your description and the photo, it's possible that it could be an insect bite, as you've suspected.\n\nThe softness of the bump when pressed is an interesting detail. While it's true that many insect bites can be firm and painful, some bites (like those from certain types of spiders or fleas) can be softer and more prone to swelling.\n\nThat being said, there are other possibilities to consider as well. For example, it could be a benign growth like a keratosis or a sebaceous cyst, or even a minor skin infection.\n\nIf you're concerned about the bump, I would recommend scheduling an appointment with your primary care physician or a dermatologist to get a proper evaluation. They can take a closer look, ask more questions about your symptoms and medical history, and provide a more informed diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try applying some over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream to help reduce any inflammation or itching. And if you notice any increasing redness, swelling, or pus, be sure to seek medical attention sooner rather than later.\n\nHope this helps, and please keep us updated on what you find out!",
    "1ib0nw": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nThank you for sharing your symptoms with us. I'll do my best to provide some insight and guidance.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you're taking proactive steps to increase your water intake, as dehydration can indeed cause some of the symptoms you're experiencing. However, since you're still noticing these symptoms, it's worth exploring other potential causes.\n\nThe tightness, abnormal heartbeat, and rapid heartbeat you're describing could be related to various factors, including:\n\n1. **Anxiety or stress**: Have you experienced any significant stress or anxiety lately? This can cause your heart to beat faster or stronger, leading to the sensations you're describing.\n2. **Caffeine or stimulant use**: Are you consuming any caffeinated beverages or taking any stimulants (e.g., energy drinks, certain medications)? These can increase heart rate and cause palpitations.\n3. **Electrolyte imbalance**: Although you're drinking more water, an electrolyte imbalance (e.g., low potassium, magnesium, or calcium levels) can still contribute to heart palpitations and arrhythmias.\n4. **Underlying cardiac conditions**: While less likely, it's possible that you may have an underlying cardiac condition, such as mitral valve prolapse, atrial fibrillation, or supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).\n\nI would recommend scheduling an appointment with your primary care physician or a cardiologist to discuss your symptoms in more detail. They can perform a physical examination, take a thorough medical history, and potentially order some diagnostic tests (e.g., ECG, echocardiogram) to rule out any underlying conditions.\n\nIn the meantime, you may want to consider keeping a symptom journal to track when these episodes occur, what you're doing at the time, and any potential triggers you've noticed.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your heart health. If you experience any severe symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please seek immediate medical attention.\n\n**Edit:** I'll be happy to answer any follow-up questions you may have, and I encourage other users to share their thoughts and experiences as well. However, please keep in mind that this is not a substitute for a professional medical evaluation.",
    "1iedku": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nI've taken a look at the image you provided, and I must say that the rash does appear to be quite concerning.

The rash could be consistent with a number of conditions, including insect bites, allergic reactions, or even a tick-borne illness (given that you mentioned being in the woods).\n\nI strongly advise your friend to seek medical attention as soon as possible. A doctor can evaluate the rash, take a thorough history, and potentially order some tests to determine the underlying cause. It's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to unusual skin lesions, especially if they're changing or growing.\n\nPlease reassure your friend that a doctor's visit is a precautionary measure, and it's always better to be safe than sorry. If she's hesitant, you could also consider scheduling a telemedicine appointment or visiting an urgent care center to get a preliminary evaluation.\n\nRemember, I'm not trying to be alarmist, but it's always better to prioritize caution when it comes to unusual symptoms. **Please encourage your friend to seek medical attention ASAP**.\n\nEdit: I'll add that if your friend experiences any systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, or joint pain, she should seek immediate medical attention.",

I understand that financial constraints can be a significant barrier to seeking medical care.\n\nFirstly, I want to commend you on taking proactive steps to identify potential triggers, such as avoiding soy protein isolate. However, it's essential to note that self-diagnosis and treatment can be challenging, and it's possible that there may be underlying conditions that require medical attention.\n\nGiven your symptoms, I'd like to suggest a few potential possibilities, but please keep in mind that these are speculative and not a substitute for a thorough medical evaluation:\n\n1. **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)**: Although you've avoided soy, IBS can manifest with persistent abdominal pain, discomfort, and changes in bowel habits. The difficulty urinating could be related to pelvic floor dysfunction, which is sometimes seen in IBS patients.\n2. **Interstitial Cystitis**: This condition can cause chronic pelvic pain, difficulty urinating, and frequent urination. It's essential to note that interstitial cystitis can be challenging to diagnose and may require a urologist's evaluation.\n3. **Adhesions or scar tissue**: As you've had an appendectomy, it's possible that adhesions or scar tissue may be contributing to your symptoms. However, this would typically require imaging studies or a surgical evaluation to confirm.\n4. **Hormonal or reproductive issues**: Given your symptoms are mostly on the left side, it's possible that there may be a gynecological or hormonal component to your condition. This could include conditions like endometriosis, ovarian cysts, or other reproductive issues.\n\nIn terms of steps you can take on your own, I recommend:\n\n1. **Keeping a symptom journal**: Track your symptoms, including when they occur, how long they last, and any potential triggers or relievers.\n2. **Staying hydrated**: Drink plenty of water to help with urination and overall digestive health.\n3. **Avoiding irritants**: Continue to avoid soy protein isolate and any other potential triggers you've identified.\n4. **Exploring community resources**: Look into local free or low-cost clinics, community health centers, or non-profit organizations that may offer affordable medical care or sliding-scale fee structures.\n\nWhile I understand that financial constraints are a challenge, I strongly encourage you to seek medical attention if your symptoms worsen or if you experience any of the following:\n\n* Severe abdominal pain\n* Vomiting or bloody stools\n* Fever or chills\n* Difficulty starting to urinate or painful urination\n* Blood in your urine\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your health.

I'd like to help you try to figure out what's going on. \n\nFirst, it's great that you've already had your thrombocytes, hemoglobin, liver function, and blood clotting tests done, and they all came back normal. That helps to rule out some of the more serious causes of easy bruising and petechiae (those tiny red spots).\n\nGiven your symptoms, there are a few other things that might be worth exploring:\n\n1. **Vitamin deficiencies**: Have you had your vitamin C and K levels checked? These vitamins play a role in blood vessel health and clotting. A deficiency could potentially contribute to easy bruising and petechiae.\n2. **Hormonal influences**: As a 20-year-old female, hormonal fluctuations could be at play. Have you noticed any correlation between your symptoms and your menstrual cycle?\n3. **Skin conditions**: There are a few skin conditions that could cause petechiae, such as telangiectasia or pigmented purpuric dermatosis. A dermatologist might be able to help you determine if one of these conditions is contributing to your symptoms.\n4. **Medications**: Are you taking any medications or supplements that could be causing your symptoms? Some medications, such as antihistamines or NSAIDs, can increase the risk of bruising and petechiae.\n5. **Autoimmune disorders**: In some cases, easy bruising and petechiae can be a sign of an underlying autoimmune disorder, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. However, these conditions often come with other symptoms, so it's possible that this isn't the cause.\n\nI would recommend talking to your primary care physician or a dermatologist about your symptoms and seeing if they can help you get to the bottom of things. They may want to run some additional tests or examine your skin more closely to determine the cause.\n\nIn the meantime, try to keep track of when your symptoms occur and if you notice any patterns. This can help your doctor get a better understanding of what's going on.\n\nHope this helps, OP! Let us know if you have any other questions.",

Generally, the medic's advice is spot on - most splinters will work their way out on their own within a few days to a week. \n\nHowever, since you mentioned it's a bit deep, I'd recommend keeping an eye on it. If it starts to get red, swollen, or painful, you should consider seeking medical attention to avoid any potential infection. \n\nRegarding the tweezers and needle method, I'd advise against it unless you're absolutely sure what you're doing. Making a cut with a needle can push the splinter further in and increase the risk of infection. If you're not comfortable waiting it out, it's better to have a medical professional take a look and remove it for you. \n\nJust keep the area clean, apply some antibiotic ointment, and monitor it for any signs of infection.

Metronidazole (the active ingredient in Metro Gel and tablets) is a common and effective treatment for BV, but it's possible that your body may not be responding to it as well as expected.\n\nI would recommend discussing the following options with your doctor:\n\n1. **Alternative treatments**: There are other antibiotics that can be used to treat BV, such as clindamycin or tinidazole. Your doctor may consider prescribing one of these alternatives if metronidazole isn't working for you.\n2. **Extended treatment duration**: In some cases, a longer treatment course may be necessary to fully clear the infection.\n3. **Combination therapy**: Your doctor may consider combining metronidazole with another antibiotic or a probiotic to enhance treatment efficacy.\n4. **Re-testing for other infections**: While your initial STD tests were negative, it's possible that you may have contracted something else since then. I would recommend getting re-tested for common STDs, such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis, to rule out any other underlying infections.\n\nIn addition to medical treatment, you may want to consider the following:\n\n1. **Probiotics**: While you've already tried a probiotic supplement, you may want to consider taking a different strain or a higher dose to see if it makes a difference.\n2. **Vaginal probiotic suppositories**: These can help restore the natural balance of bacteria in the vagina and may be beneficial in conjunction with antibiotic treatment.\n3. **Dietary changes**: You've already made some positive changes to your diet, but you may want to consider increasing your intake of foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, and antioxidants, which can help support vaginal health.\n\nRemember, it's essential to work closely with your doctor to find the right treatment approach for your specific case. Don't hesitate to ask questions or seek a second opinion if you're not satisfied with your current treatment plan.\n\nLastly, please try not to feel \"disgusting\" or ashamed about your situation. BV is a common and treatable condition, and you're taking proactive steps to address it. You got this, and with the right treatment and support, you can get your vaginal health back on track!\n\nEdit: I'll be happy to answer any follow-up questions you may have!",
    "1j0ctm": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nOP, I'd recommend taking it easy and getting evaluated ASAP. While it's possible you're just experiencing some delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) from wakeboarding, the fact that your neck pain worsened significantly with a specific movement (leaning your head back) and is now accompanied by a headache raises some red flags.\n\nThe mechanism of injury you described (landing on your head) increases the risk of a cervical spine injury or even a concussion. Icing has helped with the pain, but it's not a substitute for a proper medical evaluation.\n\nI'm not saying you should freak out, but it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to head and neck injuries. I'd recommend scheduling an urgent appointment with your primary care physician or an orthopedic specialist to get checked out.\n\nIn the meantime, avoid any heavy lifting, bending, or strenuous activities that may exacerbate the injury. Also, keep an eye on your symptoms - if you experience any numbness, tingling, weakness, or difficulty walking, seek immediate medical attention.\n\nLet's get you checked out and make sure everything is okay. **Edit:** And please, for the love of all things good, stop taking Advil and switch to acetaminophen (Tylenol) until you've been cleared by a doctor.

    "1j54i6": "**u/DocDermatology** (verified physician) \n\nHey OP, thanks for sharing this with us. I'm a dermatologist and I'd be happy to help you try to figure out what's going on. \n\nThose little black dots on your ankles could be a few things, but without seeing them in person, it's tough to say for sure. That being said, here are a few possibilities: \n\n1. **Dermatosis papulosa nigra (DPN)**: These are small, dark spots that can appear on the skin, often in clusters. They're more common in people with darker skin tones, but can occur in anyone. \n2. **Seborrheic keratoses**: These are benign growths that can appear as dark spots on the skin. They can be solitary or appear in clusters. \n3. **Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH)**: If you've had any trauma or inflammation on your lower legs (which could be related to the scars you mentioned), it's possible that you're experiencing PIH, which can cause dark spots to form. \n4. **Other possibilities**: There are many other potential causes, including melanocytic nevi (moles), solar lentigines (sun spots), or even a condition called **tinea versicolor** (although this usually causes a more widespread rash). \n\nIt's great that the spots aren't itchy or painful, as that makes some more serious conditions less likely. \n\nI would recommend seeing a dermatologist in person to get a proper evaluation and diagnosis. We can take a closer look at the spots, discuss your medical history, and figure out the best course of action. \n\nIn the meantime, if you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to ask!",
    "1j4vi3": "**u/DermDoc123 (Verified Physician)**: Hi there, concerned family member. I'm a dermatologist and I'd like to offer some insight. While it's great that you're doing your research, it's essential to take a step back and not jump to conclusions. Swollen lymph nodes can be caused by a multitude of factors, ranging from infections to autoimmune disorders, and yes, even cancer.\n\nThat being said, the presence of an irregular mole on your father's cheek and back does warrant a closer look. Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can cause swollen lymph nodes if it has spread. However, it's crucial to note that most swollen lymph nodes are not caused by melanoma.\n\nI would strongly recommend that your father schedule an appointment with a dermatologist (like myself) or a primary care physician to have the moles evaluated. A thorough examination, potentially followed by a biopsy, will help determine the cause of the swollen lymph nodes and the nature of the moles.\n\nIn the meantime, try not to worry too much about the WebMD article. While it's a great resource, it's essential to remember that online information should not replace a professional medical evaluation. Your father's doctor will be able to assess his overall health, perform a physical exam, and order any necessary tests to determine the cause of the swollen lymph nodes.\n\nPlease do keep us updated on your father's condition, and if you have any further questions, feel free to ask. **Edit:** I should note that if your father is experiencing any other symptoms such as weight loss, fatigue, or pain, he should seek medical attention promptly.",
    "1j7sam": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nI'd like to offer some additional insights, but please keep in mind that this is not a substitute for an in-person evaluation. It's great that you've already seen a doctor and had your blood pressure checked, which seems to be within a normal range.\n\nThe symptoms you're describing, particularly the worsening of head pain with standing, sneezing, or straining, could be suggestive of a few different conditions. While overexertion and a cold virus are possible contributing factors, I'm not convinced that they're the sole causes, given the persistence and worsening of your symptoms.\n\nOne possibility that comes to mind is a spinal headache or a postural headache, which can occur when there's a leak of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or a change in CSF pressure. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including a recent lumbar puncture (if you've had one), a head or neck injury, or even a spontaneous CSF leak.\n\nAnother possibility is a condition called intracranial hypotension, which can cause headaches that worsen with standing or straining. This can be due to a variety of causes, including a CSF leak, a blockage in the veins or sinuses, or even a condition like a Chiari malformation.\n\nI'd like to emphasize that these are just speculative possibilities, and a thorough evaluation by a neurologist or a primary care physician with experience in headache management would be necessary to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms.\n\nIn the meantime, I would recommend that you follow up with your doctor to discuss the possibility of further evaluation, such as imaging studies (e.g., MRI or CT scan) or a referral to a specialist. It's also important to keep track of your symptoms, including when they occur, how long they last, and any factors that seem to trigger or relieve them.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to persistent or worsening symptoms, especially if they're affecting your daily life. **Please don't hesitate to seek further medical attention if your symptoms continue to worsen or if you experience any new or concerning symptoms.**",

I notice that it's been present for a while, which suggests that it might be a chronic condition.\n\nI would strongly advise against waiting for decades to get an appointment with your doctor. Skin conditions can worsen over time and lead to more severe complications if left untreated.\n\nIf you're having trouble getting an appointment with your primary care physician, consider visiting an urgent care center or a dermatologist. They can evaluate your condition, provide a proper diagnosis, and recommend treatment options.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try some general self-care measures to help manage your symptoms. Keep the affected area clean and moisturized, avoid scratching or picking at the rash, and wear loose, breathable clothing to reduce irritation.\n\nPlease prioritize your health and seek medical attention sooner rather than later.

I'm an orthopedic specialist, but I'll try to provide some general insights. \n\nIt's concerning that your family member is experiencing recurrent, random cramping episodes, especially if they're severe enough to cause limping. Given that diabetes has been ruled out, here are a few potential causes to consider:\n\n1. **Electrolyte imbalances**: Cramping can be caused by imbalances in electrolytes like potassium, calcium, or magnesium. Has she had her electrolyte levels checked? \n2. **Muscle or nerve issues**: Conditions like muscular dystrophy, peripheral neuropathy, or radiculopathy (nerve root compression) could be contributing to her symptoms. \n3. **Hormonal fluctuations**: Hormonal changes, particularly in women, can lead to muscle cramping. Is she experiencing any other symptoms like menstrual irregularities or mood changes?\n4. **Vitamin deficiencies**: Deficiencies in vitamins like B12, D, or E can cause muscle cramping. \n5. **Underlying neurological conditions**: Certain conditions like multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, or peripheral artery disease can cause cramping.\n\nSince her identical twin doesn't have similar issues, it's possible that there's an environmental or lifestyle factor at play.\n\nAs for next steps, I would recommend:\n\n1. **Keep a symptom journal**: Encourage her to track when the cramping episodes occur, including any potential triggers or patterns.\n2. **Seek a specialist**: Consider consulting a neurologist, rheumatologist, or a physiatrist (a doctor specializing in physical medicine and rehabilitation) for a more in-depth evaluation.\n3. **Get a thorough physical exam**: A detailed physical exam can help identify any underlying musculoskeletal or neurological issues.\n4. **Explore alternative therapies**: Acupuncture, physical therapy, or massage therapy might help alleviate symptoms.\n\nRegarding her GP, it's not about \"pestering\" them, but rather advocating for herself. She should feel empowered to ask questions and seek a second opinion if needed.\n\nPlease keep in mind that this is not a substitute for a proper medical evaluation.

Before I dive in, please keep in mind that I'm not trying to diagnose your husband or replace his upcoming appointment with a specialist. That being said, based on the information you've provided, here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. **Iron deficiency anemia**: Despite his normal B12 and folate levels, iron deficiency could still be a culprit, especially given his history of massive bruising and bleeding gums. It's possible that he has a chronic, low-grade bleeding source that's not showing up on his GI tract tests.\n2. **Chronic disease anemia**: This is a type of anemia that occurs in people with chronic diseases, such as kidney disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or chronic infections. It's not necessarily related to a hematologic disorder, but rather a systemic response to the underlying disease.\n3. **Anemia of chronic inflammation**: Similar to chronic disease anemia, this type of anemia occurs in people with chronic inflammatory conditions, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Even though his GI tract tests were normal, it's possible that he has a low-grade inflammatory process that's contributing to his anemia.\n4. **Thalassemia trait**: This is a mild form of thalassemia, a genetic disorder that affects hemoglobin production. It's often asymptomatic, but can cause mild anemia. Given his long history of anemia, it's possible that he has a thalassemia trait that's contributing to his symptoms.\n5. **Hemoglobinopathy**: This is a broad term that encompasses a range of disorders that affect hemoglobin production or function. Some hemoglobinopathies, such as hemoglobin E disease, can cause mild to moderate anemia.\n\nRegarding his low total blood count, it's possible that this is related to his anemia, rather than a separate issue. His WBC and platelet counts are within normal range, which is reassuring.\n\nThe bruising and bleeding gums are concerning, but could be related to his anemia or a separate issue, such as a platelet function disorder.\n\nThe long bone aches are a new symptom, and it's possible that this is related to his anemia or a separate issue, such as a vitamin D deficiency or a musculoskeletal problem.\n\nI want to emphasize that these are just possibilities, and it's essential that your husband sees a hematologist to determine the underlying cause of his anemia. I'm sure the specialist will take a thorough history, perform a physical exam, and review his test results to determine the best course of action.\n\nTry not to worry too much, and I'm sure the hematologist will be able to provide a more detailed diagnosis and treatment plan soon.",
    "1nx7h3": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nSorry to hear you're experiencing this level of discomfort after your tetanus booster shot. While it's true that severe pain is not a common side effect, it's not unheard of either, especially if the injection was given too close to the shoulder joint or if there was some bleeding or inflammation at the injection site.\n\nFirstly, I would advise you to stop using ice and switch to heat treatment, which you've already done. Heat can help increase blood flow and reduce muscle spasms. You can also try gentle stretching and mobilization exercises to help loosen up the affected area.\n\nIn terms of pain management, you may want to consider consulting with your GP or the doctor who administered the vaccine to discuss alternative pain relief options. They may prescribe a muscle relaxant or a stronger painkiller if necessary.\n\nAs for the duration of the symptoms, it's difficult to predict exactly how long it will last, but in most cases, the pain and stiffness should start to subside within 7-10 days. However, it's possible that it may take a few weeks for the symptoms to fully resolve.\n\nIn the meantime, I would recommend taking regular breaks to stretch and move around, as prolonged periods of inactivity can exacerbate the stiffness. You can also try using a foam roller or a massage ball to help release tension in the affected area.\n\nIt's also worth noting that if you experience any of the following symptoms, you should seek medical attention immediately:\n\n* Increasing redness or swelling at the injection site\n* Fever or chills\n* Difficulty breathing or swallowing\n* Severe headache or confusion\n\nI hope this helps, and please keep us updated on your progress. **Edit:** I'll also add that if you haven't already, you should report this adverse reaction to your doctor or the vaccination clinic, as this can help with monitoring and improving vaccine safety.",

    "1oca3q": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nI've taken a look at the images you provided, and I must say that it's a bit challenging to make a definitive diagnosis without a physical examination. However, based on your description and the photos, I can offer some possible explanations.\n\nThe lesion on your cheek, which started as a small scab, could be a few things. Given your history of scratching it, it's possible that you've developed a traumatic or irritant-induced lesion, such as a pyogenic granuloma or a scratch-induced keratosis. The fact that it doesn't quite scab over and the skin feels tight around it suggests that it might be a bit more complex than a simple zit or ingrown hair.\n\nThe marks on your jaw, which appear to be similar to the one on your cheek, could be related to the same underlying process. The fact that some dead skin flaked off, leaving fresh-pink skin, suggests that there might be some ongoing inflammation or irritation in the area.\n\nRegarding the potential connection to your facial hair, it's possible that the irritation or ingrown hairs could be contributing to the development of these lesions. However, as you mentioned, the appearance of these lesions doesn't quite fit with typical ingrown hair or razor burn.\n\nTo better understand what's going on, I would recommend scheduling an appointment with a dermatologist. They can take a closer look at the lesions, perform any necessary biopsies or tests, and provide a more definitive diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\nIn the meantime, I would advise you to avoid scratching or picking at the lesions, as this can lead to further irritation and potentially cause more harm than good. You can try applying some over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream to the affected areas to help reduce inflammation, but please be sure to follow up with a dermatologist for a proper evaluation.\n\n**Edit:** I should note that there are many possible explanations for these lesions, and it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized diagnosis and treatment plan.

Now, regarding your questions on how to promote healing and reduce swelling:\n\n1. **Cold compresses**: Apply an ice pack or a cold, damp washcloth to the area for 15-20 minutes, 3-4 times a day. This will help reduce swelling and ease pain.\n2. **Elevation**: When sleeping, try to keep your head elevated using extra pillows to reduce blood flow to the area, which can help minimize swelling.\n3. **Soft food diet**: Stick to a soft food diet for the next few days to avoid irritating the stitches or putting too much pressure on your lip.\n4. **Good oral hygiene**: Keep the area clean by rinsing with warm salt water (1/4 teaspoon of salt in 8 ounces of water) several times a day. You can also use a soft-bristled toothbrush to gently clean the area.\n5. **Follow-up**: Be sure to follow up with your doctor to have the stitches removed and to monitor the healing progress.\n\nAs for the bump going down and your lip regaining its original form, it's essential to be patient. The swelling should subside within 7-10 days, but it may take a few weeks for the lip to fully heal and return to its normal shape.\n\nOne more thing: keep an eye out for signs of infection, such as increased redness, swelling, or pus.

As a neurologist, I've seen similar symptoms in various conditions, so let's break it down.\n\nThe fact that the sensation is brief, unilateral, and localized to the arch of your left foot suggests a few possibilities:\n\n1. **Morton's neuroma**: This is a common condition where a nerve in the foot becomes irritated, causing a burning or hot sensation. It's usually more pronounced when walking or bearing weight.\n2. **Peripheral nerve issue**: There could be a problem with the nerves in your foot, such as a nerve entrapment or neuropathy. However, given that you don't have any other symptoms like numbness, tingling, or weakness, this is less likely.\n3. **Referral pain**: Sometimes, pain or sensations can be referred from other areas, like the lower back or leg. However, without any other symptoms, this is also less likely.\n\nRegarding your anxiety, it's possible that stress and anxiety could be exacerbating the sensation or making you more aware of it. However, it's unlikely to be the primary cause.\n\nTo further investigate, I would recommend the following:\n\n* **See a primary care physician**: Get a thorough check-up to rule out any underlying conditions that could be contributing to the sensation.\n* **Consider a podiatry evaluation**: A foot specialist can assess your foot mechanics, check for any biomechanical issues, and rule out conditions like Morton's neuroma.\n* **Keep a symptom journal**: Track when the sensation occurs, how long it lasts, and any potential triggers. This can help identify patterns and potential correlations with your anxiety.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution and get evaluated by a healthcare professional.

    "1vknyu": "**u/Doc_Ophtho** (Verified Physician - Ophthalmology) \n\nHey OP, that's a fascinating observation. As an ophthalmologist, I've seen some unusual cases, but this one's got me intrigued. \n\nFirstly, it's essential to understand that the effects of substances like weed, painkillers, and psychedelics on the eyes are largely mediated by the autonomic nervous system, which controls pupil size (among other things). The usual response to these substances is pupil dilation or constriction due to the stimulation or inhibition of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.\n\nThere are a few possible explanations for your unique situation:\n\n1. **Anatomical variation**: It's possible that your iris muscles or the nerves controlling them might be slightly different from the average person, making them less responsive to certain substances.\n2. **Genetic factors**: Some people may have genetic variations that affect the way their eyes respond to certain drugs. For example, some individuals may have a different expression of the genes responsible for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which play a role in pupil constriction.\n3. **Color vision deficiency**: While colorblindness is unlikely to be directly related to your pupils' response to substances, it's possible that the genetic factors contributing to your color vision deficiency might also influence other aspects of your visual system, including the autonomic control of pupil size.\n4. **Other medical conditions**: Certain medical conditions, such as Adie syndrome or Holmes-Adie syndrome, can affect the pupils' response to light and accommodation. However, these conditions usually have other associated symptoms, which you don't seem to be experiencing.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the subjective effects of substances can be influenced by various factors, including individual tolerance, the specific substance and dosage, and the presence of other medical conditions.\n\nIf you're curious about your unique situation, I'd recommend consulting an ophthalmologist or a neuro-ophthalmologist for a thorough evaluation. They can perform some tests to assess your pupils' response to light and accommodation, as well as check for any underlying conditions that might be contributing to your observations.\n\nRemember, it's always important to prioritize your eye health and overall well-being, especially when using substances that can affect your vision and brain function.\n\nEdit: I'll be happy to answer any follow-up questions you might have, OP!",
    "1vl3v5": "**u/Doc_Gastro**: Verified Physician here. I'd like to offer some insights on your situation. Firstly, kudos to you for adopting a healthy diet and exercise routine. However, it's not uncommon for significant dietary changes to affect bowel movements.\n\nThe sticky, dark green/brown, and smelly stool you're experiencing could be due to a few factors. One possibility is that your diet is extremely high in fiber, particularly from the raw vegetable greens, broccoli, and cauliflower. While fiber is essential, a sudden increase can be challenging for your gut to adjust to, leading to changes in stool consistency and color.\n\nAnother potential culprit is the high intake of cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower. These veggies contain sulfur compounds, which can give stool a stronger odor. Additionally, the passionfruit, blueberries, and raspberries are high in fructose, a sugar that can be difficult for some people to digest, potentially contributing to smelly stool.\n\nThe almond meal and coconut flour \"pastries\" and bread might also be playing a role. While they're gluten-free, they can be high in phytates, which can bind to minerals and affect gut health.\n\nI'd recommend a few tweaks to your diet to see if it improves your stool quality:\n\n1. **Cook your veggies**: Try cooking your vegetables instead of eating them raw. This can make the fiber more easily digestible.\n2. **Balance your fiber intake**: While fiber is essential, make sure you're not overdoing it. You can try reducing your portion sizes of high-fiber foods or introducing them more gradually.\n3. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water to help with fiber digestion and prevent constipation.\n4. **Consider a probiotic**: Adding a probiotic supplement or eating probiotic-rich foods like fermented veggies might help your gut adjust to the new diet.\n\nRemember, everyone's gut is different, so it may take some trial and error to find the right balance for your body. If your symptoms persist or worsen, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.\n\nEdit: I'd love to hear more about your overall health and any other symptoms you might be experiencing. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels, skin, or digestive comfort since starting your new diet?",

First, let me say that it's great you're taking an active role in your health, especially at 17.\n\nNow, regarding your symptoms: it's possible that the combination of DayQuil, NyQuil, and Mucinex could be contributing to your stomach pain. These medications can be harsh on the stomach, especially when taken in high doses or for an extended period.\n\nThe fact that you've been taking DayQuil and NyQuil 4 times a day for over a week is a bit concerning. These medications are meant to be taken as needed, and taking them that frequently could lead to stomach irritation, among other issues.\n\nThe addition of Mucinex, which is an expectorant, might not be directly related to your stomach pain, but it's possible that the combination of all these medications is causing an imbalance in your gut.\n\nAs for your dream and the pain persisting after waking up, it's not uncommon for people to experience vivid dreams or even lucid dreaming when they're not feeling well. However, the fact that the pain was intense and noticeable in your dream, and then persisted after waking up, suggests that there might be an underlying issue that needs attention.\n\nI would strongly advise you to see a doctor, not just because of the stomach pain, but also because you've been taking multiple medications for an extended period. It's possible that you might have an underlying condition that needs to be addressed, or that the medications are interacting with each other in a way that's causing harm.\n\nRegarding your insurance concerns, I understand that it can be a worry, especially at 17. However, many communities have free or low-cost clinics that offer medical care to minors. You can also reach out to your school nurse or a local health department to see if they can provide any guidance or resources.\n\nDon't hesitate to seek medical attention, even if it means talking to your parents about it. Your health is important, and it's better to be safe than sorry.\n\n**Edit:** I'll add that inducing vomiting is not a recommended solution for stomach pain, as it can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. If you're experiencing persistent stomach pain, it's best to seek medical attention rather than trying to self-treat.",

It's possible that you're experiencing a vicious cycle where each issue exacerbates the others.\n\nRegarding your stomach issues, I'd like to explore a few possibilities:\n\n1. **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)**: Your symptoms of bloating, discomfort, and altered bowel habits (Bristol scale 3-6) are consistent with IBS. The fact that you've had a significant improvement after stopping bananas suggests that you may have a food intolerance or sensitivity.\n2. **Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO)**: This condition can cause similar symptoms to IBS, including bloating, abdominal pain, and altered bowel habits. SIBO is often associated with impaired gut motility, which might contribute to your delayed sleep cycle.\n3. **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**: Although you mentioned that antacids help occasionally, it's possible that you have underlying GERD, which can cause stomach discomfort, nausea, and bloating.\n\nTo address your anxiety, it's essential to recognize that it's likely a contributing factor to your stomach issues. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** or **Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)** might be helpful in managing your anxiety and reducing its impact on your stomach.\n\nRegarding your sleep cycle, **Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS)** is a possibility, as you've described. Establishing a consistent sleep schedule, avoiding screens before bedtime, and creating a relaxing bedtime routine might help regulate your sleep-wake cycle.\n\nBefore we dive deeper, I'd like to ask a few questions:\n\n* Have you noticed any correlations between your stomach symptoms and specific foods or activities?\n* Have you experienced any significant stressors or life changes in the past year that might be contributing to your anxiety?\n* Are you open to exploring lifestyle modifications, such as dietary changes, stress management techniques, or sleep hygiene practices, to help alleviate your symptoms?\n\nRemember, it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for a comprehensive evaluation and personalized guidance.

While it's not uncommon, it's essential to get a proper evaluation to rule out any underlying conditions that may be contributing to the appearance of the area.\n\nA regular doctor, such as a primary care physician or a family medicine doctor, can certainly evaluate the area and provide guidance. However, you may want to consider seeing a specialist, such as a colorectal surgeon or a dermatologist, who has more experience with perianal skin conditions and surgical repairs.\n\nTreatment options may include:\n\n1. Topical creams or ointments to help soften the scar tissue and improve the appearance of the area.\n2. Steroid injections to reduce inflammation and promote healing.\n3. Surgical revision to excise the scar tissue and repair the area.\n\nIt's essential to note that any surgical procedure carries risks, and it's crucial to discuss the potential benefits and risks with a qualified healthcare professional.\n\nI would recommend starting with a primary care physician or a dermatologist to get an initial evaluation and guidance. They can then refer you to a specialist if needed.\n\nRemember, it's always better to prioritize your health and seek medical attention if you're concerned about the appearance or function of any part of your body.\n\n**Edit:** I want to emphasize that it's great that you're taking proactive steps to address your concerns.

    "1xphfu": "**u/Doc_Skeptical** (Verified Physician) \n\nHey OP, I'm going to give it to you straight. As a physician, I'm concerned about your daily energy drink habit, regardless of your weight or exercise routine. While it's great that you're physically active and not overweight, the risks associated with long-term energy drink consumption can't be ignored.\n\nFirstly, the high caffeine content in Euro Shopper energy drinks (I'm assuming it's similar to other energy drinks on the market) can lead to caffeine toxicity, even at moderate doses. Drinking 1 liter daily puts you at risk of experiencing jitters, anxiety, insomnia, and an increased heart rate. Prolonged consumption can also lead to caffeine dependence, which you've already acknowledged.\n\nMoreover, energy drinks often contain other stimulants like taurine, guarana, and B vitamins, which can interact with each other and with caffeine in unpredictable ways. The long-term effects of these interactions are not well understood and may pose additional health risks.\n\nAdditionally, the high sugar content in many energy drinks can contribute to dental problems, insulin resistance, and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, even if you're not overweight.\n\nI'm not here to lecture you, but I want to emphasize that it's not just about the immediate effects. Chronic energy drink consumption can have long-term consequences, such as:\n\n* Cardiovascular problems (e.g., high blood pressure, cardiac arrhythmias)\n* Liver damage\n* Kidney damage\n* Nutrient imbalances and deficiencies\n\nI strongly advise you to consider reducing your energy drink intake or switching to a healthier alternative. If you're finding it difficult to quit, you may want to consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian for guidance.\n\nRemember, just because you're not experiencing immediate negative effects doesn't mean you're not putting your health at risk. It's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your well-being.\n\nEdit: I'd like to add that it's great that you're aware of your addiction and willing to consider the potential risks. That's the first step towards making a positive change.",
    "1xslxs": "Username: throwaway_md_phd \n\nComment:\n\"Hey fellow Redditors, verified physician here. I think there's been a bit of confusion in this thread. When we refer to 'race' in a medical context, we're not talking about the social or cultural construct of race, but rather the biological and genetic differences that exist between populations. \n\nThese differences can affect how certain diseases manifest, how we respond to medications, and even our susceptibility to certain conditions. For example, sickle cell disease is more prevalent in populations of African descent, while cystic fibrosis is more common in those of European ancestry.\n\nIt's not about implying that one 'race' is superior to another, but rather about recognizing that our genetic backgrounds can influence our health outcomes. And yes, this subreddit is indeed focused on human health, but we welcome discussions about how our understanding of human biology and genetics can inform our approach to healthcare.\n\nLet's keep the conversation civil and focused on the science.

We're here to learn from each other and improve patient care.\" \n\n Verified MD/PhD",
    "1xsnj8": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nI'd like to help you out with your symptoms. While it's great that you've provided a detailed history, I must emphasize that a definitive diagnosis requires a thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional.\n\nThat being said, your symptoms do suggest a possible connection to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or a hiatal hernia, as you've mentioned. However, the absence of typical reflux symptoms like heartburn, acid taste, and pain makes it a bit more complex.\n\nThe fact that you experience retching and a sensation of impending vomiting, especially during periods of stress, physical exertion, or after consuming certain foods/drinks, could be related to an exacerbation of reflux symptoms. The compression of your stomach and lungs during martial arts or wrestling could also be a contributing factor.\n\nThe decreased lung capacity and panic when you're out of breath are interesting additions to your symptoms. This might suggest a possible overlap with anxiety or panic disorder, which can sometimes manifest with physical symptoms like shortness of breath and chest tightness.\n\nI'd like to propose a few potential explanations:\n\n1. **GERD or hiatal hernia**: As you've mentioned, this could be a possible underlying condition, especially given your symptoms of retching and nausea.\n2. **Anxiety or panic disorder**: Your symptoms of panic and shortness of breath during physical exertion or stress could be related to an underlying anxiety or panic disorder.\n3. **Gastroparesis**: This is a condition where the stomach muscles are weakened, leading to delayed emptying of food from the stomach. This could contribute to your symptoms of nausea, retching, and discomfort after eating.\n4. **Other possibilities**: Other conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia, or even a cardiac issue (although less likely, given your age and lack of other symptoms) could also be considered.\n\nTo further investigate your symptoms, I recommend the following:\n\n* Consult a gastroenterologist to discuss your symptoms and potential underlying conditions like GERD or hiatal hernia.\n* Consider a pulmonary function test (PFT) to assess your lung capacity and rule out any underlying respiratory issues.\n* Discuss your symptoms with a mental health professional to explore the possibility of an anxiety or panic disorder.\n* Keep a symptom journal to track your episodes and potential triggers, which can help your healthcare provider better understand your condition.\n\nRemember, a thorough evaluation and diagnosis by a qualified healthcare professional are essential to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms.\n\n**Edit:** I'll be happy to answer any follow-up questions you may have, and I encourage you to consult with a healthcare professional as soon as possible to discuss your symptoms in more detail.",
    "1xspvw": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nI understand your concern as a parent, and it's great that you're advocating for your daughter's health. However, I'd like to offer some perspective on the situation.\n\nFirstly, the pediatrician's approach seems reasonable given the initial presentation. The negative flu and strep swabs do suggest that it might be a viral upper respiratory infection, which is a common cause of fever and agitation in children.\n\nRegarding the blood test, it's not always necessary to order one to differentiate between bacterial and viral infections. In fact, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends against routine blood work for children with suspected viral infections, as it can lead to unnecessary testing and potential harm.\n\nThat being said, I do agree that your daughter's agitation and sleep disturbance are red flags that warrant further attention. It's possible that she might have a bacterial infection, such as pneumonia or a urinary tract infection, that needs to be ruled out.\n\nI would suggest calling the pediatrician's office and expressing your concerns again. Ask if they would be willing to consider additional testing, such as a complete blood count (CBC) or a urinalysis, to help determine the cause of your daughter's symptoms. It's also important to monitor her condition closely and seek immediate attention if you notice any worsening of symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, severe abdominal pain, or signs of dehydration.\n\nRemember, as a parent, you know your child best, and it's always okay to advocate for further evaluation if you're not comfortable with the initial diagnosis. Keep pushing for answers, and I hope your daughter feels better soon.\n\n**Edit:** I want to emphasize that it's essential to follow up with the pediatrician's office and not delay seeking further medical attention if you're concerned about your daughter's condition. If you're unsure about the diagnosis or treatment plan, consider seeking a second opinion or taking her to the emergency department if you think it's an emergency.",
    "1xtzyf": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nOP, I'm glad you're taking proactive steps to understand the risks associated with your medication regimen. As a physician, I want to address your concerns and provide some guidance.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that you're taking a significant amount of Tylenol (acetaminophen) daily, often exceeding the recommended maximum dose of 4000mg. While it's understandable that you're trying to manage your chronic pain, I must emphasize that long-term, high-dose acetaminophen use can increase the risk of liver damage.\n\nGiven your medical history, including scoliosis correction and fibromyalgia, I appreciate the complexity of your pain management. However, I strongly advise you to consult with your primary care physician or a pain management specialist to reassess your treatment plan.\n\nIn the meantime, I recommend the following:\n\n1. **Do not exceed 4000mg of Tylenol per day**. If you're experiencing breakthrough pain, consider alternative pain management strategies, such as:\n\t* Adjusting your tramadol and Cymbalta dosages (under medical supervision).\n\t* Exploring other pain relief options, like physical therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, or alternative medications.\n2. **Get your liver enzymes checked**. Schedule a blood test to assess your liver function (ALT, AST, and bilirubin levels). This will help determine if your liver is being affected by your current medication regimen.\n3. **Consider a liver-protective medication**. Your doctor may prescribe a medication like N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to help mitigate potential liver damage.\n\nRegarding your concern about needing a liver transplant, it's unlikely that you'll require one immediately. However, it's crucial to take proactive steps to protect your liver health.\n\nPlease schedule an appointment with your doctor to discuss your concerns and develop a revised treatment plan. Remember, it's essential to prioritize your liver health while managing your chronic pain.\n\n**Edit:** I want to emphasize that it's crucial to work with your healthcare provider to find alternative pain management strategies.

    "1xuk90": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nI'm glad you're taking your symptoms seriously and seeking a second opinion. As a cardiologist, I'd like to offer some insight. Early repolarization is a common EKG finding, especially in young people, and it's often benign. However, it's essential to consider the clinical context, which in your case, includes a long history of chest pain and exertional dyspnea (getting winded easily).\n\nWhile your family doc may have reassured you, I wouldn't entirely ignore your symptoms. The fact that you've had chest pain since age 14, and it's persistent, warrants further evaluation. The addition of a dull feeling on the left side, even at rest, is concerning and should be investigated.\n\nI'd recommend seeing a cardiologist for a more thorough assessment. We can discuss your symptoms in more detail, perform a physical exam, and possibly order additional tests such as:\n\n1. Echocardiogram to evaluate your heart's structure and function.\n2. Stress test or treadmill test to assess your heart's response to exercise.\n3. Holter monitor or event monitor to capture any arrhythmic events.\n4. Blood work to check for any underlying conditions that may be contributing to your symptoms.\n\nIt's also important to address your exertional dyspnea. This could be related to your heart, but it's also possible that there are other factors at play, such as asthma, anemia, or deconditioning.\n\nDon't be discouraged if your family doc seemed dismissive. It's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to chest pain and cardiac symptoms. Make an appointment with a cardiologist, and let's get to the bottom of this.\n\n**Edit:** I should note that being of Indian descent does increase your risk for cardiovascular disease, so it's great that you're being proactive about your health.",
    "1xv761": "**u/DocOnCall**: Hey there, fellow Redditor! I'm a verified physician and I'd be happy to help you out. \n\nFirst, let's talk about your heart rate. A resting heart rate of 90 bpm is indeed on the higher side, but it's not uncommon, especially in younger individuals. The fact that it drops to 70-78 bpm in the evenings is a good sign, as it suggests that your heart rate is able to adapt to different situations.\n\nGiven your lifestyle and diet, I think it's possible that your high heart rate could be related to your nutrition. As a college student, it's not uncommon to have a diet that's high in processed foods and low in essential nutrients. I'd like to highlight a few potential culprits:\n\n1. **Dehydration**: Not drinking enough water can lead to an increase in heart rate. Make sure you're drinking plenty of water throughout the day.\n2. **Electrolyte imbalance**: A diet low in fruits and vegetables can lead to an imbalance of essential electrolytes like potassium, magnesium, and calcium. These electrolytes play a crucial role in regulating heart rhythm.\n3. **Caffeine**: Although you mentioned that your heart rate is high before you drink coffee, it's still possible that caffeine is contributing to your elevated heart rate. Try cutting back on coffee or switching to decaf to see if it makes a difference.\n4. **Vitamin deficiencies**: Deficiencies in vitamins like B12, iron, or magnesium can also contribute to an elevated heart rate.\n\nAs for supplements, I would recommend talking to your doctor before adding anything new to your regimen. However, if you're looking to make some changes, you could consider:\n\n1. **Omega-3 fatty acids**: These healthy fats can help reduce inflammation and promote heart health.\n2. **Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)**: This antioxidant can help support energy production in your cells and may help reduce heart rate.\n3. **Magnesium and potassium supplements**: If you're found to be deficient in these electrolytes, supplements may be helpful.\n\nIt's great that you're planning to re-check your blood pressure, and I would recommend scheduling a doctor's appointment to discuss your concerns. Your doctor can help you rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to your high heart rate.\n\nIn the meantime, I would encourage you to make some lifestyle changes, such as:\n\n1. **Increasing your fruit and vegetable intake**: Aim for at least 5 servings a day to help ensure you're getting essential nutrients.\n2. **Staying hydrated**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day, and aim for at least 8 cups (64 oz) daily.\n3. **Reducing processed foods**: Try to limit your intake of frozen dinners and fast food, and opt for whole, nutrient-dense foods instead.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your health. If you're concerned about your heart rate, it's always best to consult with a medical professional to rule out any underlying conditions.\n\nHope this helps, and please keep us updated on your progress!",

The fluctuations you're experiencing are not uncommon, especially in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).\n\nThere are several factors that could contribute to these fluctuations:\n\n1. **White coat effect**: Although you're taking your readings at home, you might still be experiencing some anxiety or stress when taking your blood pressure, which can cause a temporary spike.\n2. **Postural changes**: Even if you're sitting in the same position, slight changes in posture or movement can affect blood pressure readings.\n3. **Medication effects**: Metoprolol tartrate, the medication you're taking, can cause blood pressure to fluctuate, especially when you first start taking it.\n4. **Underlying HCM**: As you mentioned, your HCM might be contributing to these fluctuations. HCM can affect the heart's ability to regulate blood pressure, leading to more variability.\n\nThe fluctuations you've described, up to 30 points within minutes, are significant but not necessarily alarming. However, it's essential to discuss these findings with your cardiologist, as they can help determine the best course of action.\n\nIn the meantime, I recommend:\n\n1. **Continue monitoring**: Keep tracking your blood pressure readings to identify any patterns or trends.\n2. **Take multiple readings**: Take multiple readings at different times of the day to get a more accurate picture of your blood pressure.\n3. **Note any symptoms**: If you experience any symptoms like dizziness, lightheadedness, or chest pain, seek medical attention immediately.\n\nWhen you meet with your cardiologist, be sure to discuss your concerns and provide them with your blood pressure log. They can help you interpret the results and adjust your treatment plan if needed.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your heart health. I'm sure your cardiologist will be able to provide you with personalized guidance and reassurance.\n\n**Edit**: I'll be happy to answer any follow-up questions you may have after your cardiologist appointment!",
    "1xwl6f": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nHey OP, sorry to hear that you're experiencing some unpleasant symptoms. Petechiae (small pinpoint spots due to bleeding under the skin) on the eyes and cheekbones can be concerning, especially when combined with vomiting.\n\nThere are a few possible explanations for what you're experiencing, but I want to emphasize that this is not a substitute for a proper medical evaluation. That being said, here are a few potential causes:\n\n1. **Vomiting-induced petechiae**: Forceful vomiting can lead to increased pressure in the small blood vessels of the face, causing them to rupture and resulting in petechiae.\n2. **Dehydration**: Severe dehydration can cause blood vessels to become more fragile, leading to easy bruising and petechiae.\n3. **Infection**: Certain infections, such as mononucleosis or endocarditis, can cause petechiae, although these would typically be accompanied by other symptoms like fever, fatigue, and sore throat.\n4. **Bleeding disorders**: In rare cases, petechiae can be a sign of an underlying bleeding disorder, such as thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction.\n\nI strongly advise you to consult with a healthcare professional as soon as possible to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms.

The fact that you're experiencing persistent diarrhea, vomiting, and now heaving suggests that something more serious might be going on.\n\nFirst, please don't take your dad's advice on sipping soda. While it might provide some temporary relief, it's not a good idea to introduce more sugar and carbonation into your system when you're already experiencing GI distress.\n\nIn terms of eating, I would recommend sticking to a bland diet for now, such as bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast (BRAT diet). Avoid spicy, fatty, or high-fiber foods that can exacerbate your symptoms.

Even if all the lymph nodes (nodes) were negative for cancer, it's still possible for cancer to spread to other parts of the body, including the lungs, through other mechanisms such as hematogenous spread (through the bloodstream) or direct extension.\n\nIn the case of biliary cancer, it's not uncommon for the cancer to spread to the lungs, even if the lymph nodes are negative. The presence of a pleural effusion could be a sign of metastatic disease, but it could also be caused by other conditions such as infection, inflammation, or other non-cancerous processes.\n\nI would recommend that your family member undergo further testing, such as a CT-guided biopsy or thoracentesis (fluid sampling), to determine the cause of the pleural effusion. It's also essential to discuss the results and the overall clinical picture with their oncologist to determine the best course of action.\n\nKeep in mind that every patient's situation is unique, and it's crucial to consider all the factors involved.

I've taken a look at the photos you provided, and while I'm not able to make a definitive diagnosis without a physical exam and potentially some imaging, I can try to offer some general guidance.\n\nIt's great that you've been elevating and icing the ankle, as that can help with pain and swelling. The fact that you're able to move it, but it hurts, suggests that it might not be a severe fracture. However, it's still possible that you could have a non-displaced or hairline fracture, which can be tricky to diagnose without an X-ray or other imaging.\n\nIn terms of how a fracture might feel, it can vary depending on the location and severity. Some common symptoms of a fracture include:\n\n* Severe pain, especially with weight-bearing or movement\n* Swelling, bruising, or deformity\n* Instability or feeling like the ankle is going to \"give way\"\n* Limited range of motion or stiffness\n\nThat being said, it's also possible that you could have a severe sprain or other soft tissue injury, which can be just as painful as a fracture.\n\nI would recommend that you get seen by a medical professional as soon as possible, preferably someone who specializes in orthopedics or sports medicine. They can perform a thorough exam, potentially order some imaging, and provide a more definitive diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\nIn the meantime, continue to elevate and ice the ankle, and try to avoid putting too much weight on it. If you experience any numbness, tingling, or coldness in the foot, or if you have difficulty moving the ankle at all, seek medical attention right away.\n\nHope this helps, and please keep us updated on your progress!",
    "1y7v8t": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nI'm glad you're taking the first step towards a healthier lifestyle, but I have to advise you to approach these \"7-day cleanses\" with caution. As a physician, I've seen many patients who've tried these fad diets, and unfortunately, they're often more hype than substance.\n\nThe concept of a \"detox\" is misleading, as our bodies already have a built-in detoxification system - the liver, kidneys, and digestive system - that does a great job of removing toxins. These cleanses often claim to \"flush out toxins,\" but there's no scientific evidence to support this.\n\nIn fact, many of these cleanses can be harmful, particularly if you're not eating solid food for an extended period. You may experience:\n\n* Nutrient deficiencies\n* Dehydration\n* Electrolyte imbalances\n* Decreased muscle mass\n* Slowed metabolism\n\nAdditionally, if you're drinking and smoking regularly, a cleanse is not a substitute for addressing these underlying health issues.\n\nInstead, I recommend focusing on sustainable lifestyle changes:\n\n1. **Eat a balanced diet**: Focus on whole, unprocessed foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.\n2. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day.\n3. **Exercise regularly**: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week.\n4. **Limit alcohol and tobacco use**: Try to reduce your drinking and smoking to once a week or less, and consider quitting altogether.\n5. **Get enough sleep**: Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night.\n\nIf you're looking for a \"detox,\" consider a **gentle, evidence-based approach**:\n\n* Try a 3-5 day **plant-based diet** with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.\n* Incorporate **herbal teas** like peppermint, ginger, or dandelion root, which can support digestion and liver function.\n* Consider a **probiotic supplement** to support gut health.\n\nRemember, a healthy lifestyle is about making sustainable changes, not quick fixes.

First, it's great that you're taking an active role in monitoring your health, but I have to advise you to be cautious of Dr. Google - it's easy to get caught up in worst-case scenarios online.\n\nYour symptoms of shortness of breath, tightness in the throat/upper chest, and the need to cough are non-specific and can be caused by a variety of factors, including anxiety (which you mentioned you're experiencing). It's possible that your anxiety is exacerbating your symptoms, creating a vicious cycle.\n\nNow, regarding your \"perfect\" test results: you're right, your BP, capillary refill, and resting heart rate are all within normal limits. However, it's essential to understand that heart failure is a complex condition, and its presentation can vary greatly from person to person.\n\nWhile it's unlikely that an 18-year-old would have heart failure, it's not impossible. That being said, if someone with heart failure were to present with normal BP, capillary refill, and resting heart rate, it would likely be in the early stages of the condition, and other symptoms like fatigue, swelling, or exercise intolerance might be more prominent.\n\nThe key takeaway here is that your symptoms and test results don't necessarily align with heart failure, but that doesn't mean you should ignore them. I would recommend speaking with your primary care physician or a cardiologist to discuss your concerns and undergo a thorough evaluation. They can assess your overall health, perform additional tests if needed, and help you determine the cause of your symptoms.\n\nIn the meantime, try to manage your anxiety through relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga. It might also be helpful to keep a symptom journal to track when your symptoms occur and what might trigger them.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution and consult with a healthcare professional than to self-diagnose or worry excessively.

As a pulmonologist, I've seen my fair share of unusual breathing patterns, but this one's a new one.\n\nFrom what you've described, it sounds like you're exhibiting a behavior that's similar to a combination of diaphragmatic breathing exercises and a technique called \"box breathing\" or \"square breathing.\" The act of taking a deep breath, holding it, and then exhaling slowly can be beneficial for relaxation and stress relief.\n\nThe cheek-puffing and squeezing part is a bit more unusual, but it's possible that you're using this as a way to slow down your exhalation and control your breathing. Some people use similar techniques to help regulate their breathing and calm their nervous system.\n\nI'm not aware of any specific medical condition that would cause this exact behavior, but it's possible that you've developed this habit as a way to self-soothe or cope with stress.\n\nIf you don't mind me asking, do you find that you do this more often when you're feeling anxious or stressed?

However, I have to advise you that it's not always easy to distinguish between viral and bacterial infections without a proper evaluation.\n\nThat being said, based on your symptoms, it's possible that you have a viral pharyngitis. The absence of tonsils doesn't necessarily affect the diagnosis, but it can make it slightly more challenging. The redness and pale raised areas in the back of your throat could be consistent with a viral infection, such as a coronavirus or rhinovirus.\n\nThe fact that you don't have any white patches or exudates (which are often seen in strep throat) and your voice isn't affected suggests that it might not be a bacterial infection like streptococcal pharyngitis. However, it's essential to note that some bacterial infections, like mycoplasma or chlamydia, can present with similar symptoms.\n\nThe pain with swallowing (odynophagia) is concerning, and I would recommend that you don't try to self-diagnose or delay seeking medical attention. While Tylenol can help with pain management, it's crucial to get a proper evaluation to rule out any bacterial infections that may require antibiotic treatment.\n\nI would strongly advise you to schedule an appointment with your primary care physician or an urgent care center. They can perform a thorough examination, including a throat swab or rapid strep test, to determine the cause of your symptoms. If it's a viral infection, they can provide guidance on symptom management and supportive care. If it's a bacterial infection, they can prescribe the appropriate antibiotic treatment.\n\nDon't worry about \"wasting time\" at the doctor's office. It's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your health. Get evaluated, and let the professionals help you determine the best course of action.\n\n**Edit:** I see that you're taking Tylenol for pain, which is a good start.

    "1yay04": "**u/DocDownUnder** (Verified Physician) \n\nHey there, I'm a GP in Australia. I understand your concerns about antibiotics, but I have to advise you that in the case of strep throat, the benefits of taking antibiotics far outweigh the risks. \n\nStrep throat is caused by Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), and if left untreated, it can lead to serious complications like rheumatic fever, kidney damage, and abscesses. Rheumatic fever, in particular, is a significant concern, as it can cause long-term damage to the heart valves. \n\nThe risk of developing rheumatic fever after untreated strep throat is estimated to be around 0.3-3% in developed countries like Australia. However, this risk can be significantly reduced to almost zero with appropriate antibiotic treatment.\n\nRegarding the impact of antibiotics on your microbiome, it's true that they can disrupt the balance of gut bacteria. However, the effects are usually temporary, and most people's microbiomes recover within a few weeks to months after completing the course. The 6-month recovery time you mentioned is likely an overestimation, and more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects.\n\nIn your case, as a 22-year-old male with a healthy weight and height, your risk of complications from untreated strep throat is relatively low, but it's still not worth taking the chance. I would strongly recommend completing a full course of antibiotics as prescribed by your doctor. \n\nIt's also worth noting that there are ways to mitigate the effects of antibiotics on your microbiome, such as taking probiotics during and after the course, eating a balanced diet rich in fiber, and staying hydrated.\n\nDon't take the risk of developing rheumatic fever or other complications. Take the antibiotics, and discuss any concerns you have with your doctor. They can help you weigh the benefits and risks and provide guidance on how to minimize the impact on your microbiome.\n\n**Edit:** I should mention that if you're experiencing any symptoms like a severe sore throat, difficulty swallowing, or a fever over 38.5\u00b0C, you should seek medical attention immediately.",

The fact that it popped without pain is consistent with a benign lesion.\n\nHowever, it's always best to get a professional opinion, especially when it comes to genital lesions. I would recommend scheduling an appointment with a primary care physician or a dermatologist to get a proper evaluation. They can take a look, possibly do a biopsy if needed, and give you a definitive diagnosis.\n\nIn the meantime, keep the area clean and dry, and avoid scratching or picking at it. And just to reiterate, if you experience any increased redness, swelling, or pain, seek medical attention sooner rather than later.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your health. **Don't self-diagnose, get a pro to take a look**.",
    "1ybqz7": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nGreat job on prioritizing a healthy diet and regular exercise! As for your question, the answer is a bit nuanced. Drinking a protein shake after a workout can be beneficial, but it's not a magic bullet.\n\nThe idea behind post-workout protein shakes is to help with muscle recovery and growth. When you exercise, you cause micro-tears in your muscles, and protein is essential for repairing and rebuilding them. Consuming protein within 30-60 minutes after a workout can help promote muscle protein synthesis, which can aid in recovery and potentially improve muscle growth over time.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that you don't necessarily need a protein shake to achieve this. A balanced meal with protein, complex carbs, and healthy fats can provide the same benefits. For example, a meal with grilled chicken, brown rice, and avocado would be an excellent post-workout option.\n\nThat being said, protein shakes can be convenient and helpful if you're struggling to get enough protein in your diet or if you're looking for a quick and easy way to refuel after a workout. If you do choose to use protein shakes, make sure to select a product with a balanced amino acid profile and minimal added sugars.\n\nIn your case, since you're already eating healthy and working out regularly, you might not see a significant difference from adding a protein shake to your routine. But if you're looking for a convenient way to support your muscle recovery, it could be worth trying.\n\nAs for wasting your money, consider this: if you're spending $30-50 per month on protein shakes and you're not seeing any noticeable benefits, it might not be the best use of your resources. On the other hand, if you find that it helps you recover faster and supports your fitness goals, it could be a worthwhile investment.\n\nUltimately, the decision to use protein shakes should be based on your individual needs and goals. I recommend experimenting with different post-workout nutrition strategies to see what works best for you.\n\n**Edit:** I should note that as a physician, I always recommend speaking with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian before starting any new supplements, including protein shakes. They can help you determine the best approach for your specific needs and health status.",

First, let me commend you for being proactive about your blood pressure management, especially considering your plans for pregnancy.\n\nIt's not uncommon for patients to experience a rebound effect when switching from a beta blocker like atenolol to a different medication. The fact that you had a similar reaction when trying to go off BP meds over the summer suggests that you may be experiencing a bit of a withdrawal effect.\n\nLabetalol is a good choice for pregnancy, but it's possible that the dose may need to be adjusted. I would recommend discussing the following options with your doctor:\n\n1. **Dose adjustment**: Consider increasing the dose of labetalol to achieve better blood pressure control. However, this should be done under close monitoring to avoid any potential side effects.\n2. **Addition of a diuretic**: A low-dose diuretic like hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) may help to augment the blood pressure-lowering effect of labetalol.\n3. **Alternative medications**: If you're experiencing significant side effects or inadequate blood pressure control with labetalol, your doctor may consider alternative medications like nifedipine or methyldopa, which are also safe for use during pregnancy.\n4. **Close monitoring**: Regular blood pressure checks and monitoring of your symptoms will help your doctor to adjust your treatment plan accordingly.\n\nI would encourage you to schedule a follow-up appointment with your doctor to discuss these options in more detail. It's essential to work closely with your healthcare provider to find a treatment plan that balances your blood pressure control with the need to minimize potential risks during pregnancy.\n\nRemember, as a patient, you have the right to advocate for yourself and seek a second opinion if you're not satisfied with your doctor's response. **Stay calm, and don't hesitate to reach out to your doctor or a specialist if you have any further concerns**.\n\nEdit: I'll add that it's crucial to discuss your concerns and any changes to your medication regimen with your obstetrician as well, to ensure that everyone is on the same page regarding your pregnancy and blood pressure management.",

As a physician, I'll offer some advice, but please keep in mind that I'm not your treating doctor, and it's essential to follow your doctor's instructions.\n\nFirstly, it's excellent that you're on two antibiotics, cephalexin and doxycycline, as impetigo can be caused by multiple bacteria. The fact that your symptoms have improved slightly with treatment is a good sign.\n\nRegarding your concerns about the state tournament, I understand your eagerness to participate. However, it's crucial to prioritize your health and the health of others. Since your doctor has confirmed that you're no longer contagious, that's a positive step.\n\nTo address your questions:\n\n1. **Popping blisters**: You're correct in not popping the blisters. This can lead to further infection, scarring, and delayed healing.\n2. **Warm compresses**: Applying warm compresses to the affected area can help promote drainage and reduce discomfort. You can try soaking a clean cloth in warm water, wring it out, and apply it to the area for 10-15 minutes, 2-3 times a day.\n3. **Creams**: Over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream (1%) can help reduce inflammation and redness. However, I would recommend consulting your doctor before using any new creams, as they may interact with your current medications.\n4. **Scabbing**: It's normal for some areas to dry up and form scabs. Keep the area clean and moisturized to promote healing.\n\nTo make the affected area look less noticeable, you can try the following:\n\n1. **Keep the area clean**: Gently wash the area with mild soap and lukewarm water.\n2. **Apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly**: This can help protect the skin and reduce redness.\n3. **Use a non-comedogenic moisturizer**: This can help keep the skin hydrated and reduce the appearance of scabs.\n\nRemember to follow your doctor's advice and attend your follow-up appointments to ensure your condition is improving. If you have any further questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to your doctor.\n\nAs for the tournament, it's essential to prioritize your health and the health of others. If you're cleared by your doctor to participate, you can provide the necessary documentation to the tournament organizers. However, if your condition worsens or you experience any adverse reactions to the medications, it's crucial to prioritize your health and safety.\n\nGood luck with your tournament, and I hope you make a full recovery soon!",
    "1yeh9m": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nHey OP, thanks for reaching out. I'll do my best to help you with your ear wax concerns. \n\nFirstly, it's great that you don't have any underlying medical issues or medications that could be contributing to your ear wax concerns. \n\nRegarding your question, the frequency of using Murine ear drops depends on the severity of your ear wax buildup. If you're experiencing mild symptoms, using the drops once a month might be sufficient. However, if you're experiencing more frequent or severe symptoms, you may need to use them more often.\n\nAs for the dosage, the typical recommendation is to use 5 drops, twice daily, for 2-3 days. This can help loosen the ear wax and make it easier to remove. \n\nYour method of using the drops is mostly correct. After putting a few drops in your ear, lying down for 10-15 minutes can help the drops penetrate deeper into the ear canal. When you're ready to let the wax drip out, it's a good idea to do so over a sink, as you mentioned. \n\nRinsing with lukewarm water afterwards is also a good idea, but make sure to do so gently. You can use a bulb syringe or a soft cloth to wipe away any remaining wax or debris. Avoid using cotton swabs (Q-tips) as they can push the wax further into your ear canal and potentially cause damage.\n\nOne more thing to keep in mind: if you experience any discomfort, pain, or difficulty hearing after using the ear drops, you should stop using them and consult with a healthcare professional. \n\nI hope that helps, OP! If you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to ask.\n\n**Edit:** I should mention that it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional (like an ENT specialist or a primary care physician) if you're unsure about how to manage your ear wax or if you experience any persistent symptoms.

    "1yex0l": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nI'm so sorry to hear about the Diffuse Pontine Glioma (DIPG) diagnosis. As a pediatric neuro-oncologist, I've had the unfortunate experience of dealing with this devastating tumor. I'll try to provide some insight and address the treatment options you've mentioned.\n\nFirstly, it's true that conventional treatments for DIPG have limited efficacy, and the prognosis is generally poor. Current standard treatments include radiation therapy, which can help alleviate symptoms, but unfortunately, it's not curative.\n\nRegarding the cannabis extract, there is some preclinical evidence suggesting that cannabinoids may have anti-tumor effects in certain types of cancer, including gliomas. However, it's essential to note that the evidence for its effectiveness in DIPG is largely anecdotal, and there are no robust clinical trials to support its use as a treatment. That being said, some families have reported positive experiences with cannabis extracts, particularly in terms of symptom management and quality of life.\n\nAs for the muscadine grape extract, I couldn't find any reliable scientific evidence to support its use as a treatment for DIPG. While muscadine grapes do contain compounds with potential anti-cancer properties, there is no concrete evidence to suggest that they are effective against DIPG.\n\nI understand that the lack of treatment options and the poor prognosis can be frustrating and desperate. However, as a physician, I must emphasize the importance of relying on evidence-based medicine and avoiding unproven or untested treatments that may pose unnecessary risks or interact with conventional therapies.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring alternative or complementary therapies, I recommend discussing them with your child's oncologist or a qualified healthcare professional to ensure that they are safe and won't interfere with conventional treatments.\n\nAdditionally, there are some ongoing clinical trials investigating new treatments for DIPG, such as immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and gene therapy. You may want to consult with your child's oncologist or a clinical trials specialist to see if your child may be eligible for any of these trials.\n\nPlease keep in mind that every child with DIPG is unique, and it's essential to work closely with a qualified healthcare team to determine the best course of treatment.\n\nI hope this information helps, and I'm happy to answer any further questions you may have.\n\n**Edit:** I've seen some comments mentioning the need for more research and funding for DIPG. I couldn't agree more. As a medical community, we need to continue advocating for more research and resources to combat this devastating disease.",

Your lipid profile is indeed concerning, but it's great that you're taking proactive steps to address it.\n\nFirstly, kudos to you for recognizing the importance of lifestyle changes. A strict diet and regular exercise can definitely help improve your cholesterol levels. However, it's essential to understand that achieving significant changes in just a month can be challenging.\n\nThat being said, it's not impossible. With a healthy diet and regular physical activity, you can potentially lower your LDL cholesterol by 10-20% and increase your HDL cholesterol by 5-10% in a short period. Triglycerides can also be reduced significantly with dietary changes and exercise.\n\nGiven your starting point, here are some realistic expectations:\n\n* Total Cholesterol: You might be able to reduce it by 20-30 points, which would put you around 278-288 mg/dL. Still high, but an improvement.\n* HDL Cholesterol: With regular exercise and a healthy diet, you might be able to increase it by 5-10 points, which would put you around 44-49 mg/dL. Still short of the target, but better.\n* Triglycerides: You can potentially reduce them by 50-100 points, which would put you around 295-345 mg/dL. Again, still high, but an improvement.\n* LDL-Cholesterol: This might be the toughest one to budge. You might be able to reduce it by 10-20 points, which would put you around 219-229 mg/dL. Still above the target.\n\nIt's crucial to remember that everyone's body responds differently to lifestyle changes. While some people might see significant improvements in a short period, others might not.\n\nMedication might still be necessary to help you reach your target values, especially considering your family history of high cholesterol. Your doctor will be able to assess your progress and decide the best course of action.\n\nIn the meantime, stick to your plan, and make sure to:\n\n* Eat a heart-healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein sources.\n* Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise, or a combination of both, per week.\n* Incorporate strength training exercises to help improve your overall fitness and metabolism.\n* Get enough sleep (7-8 hours) and manage stress levels.\n\nYou've got this, OP!

    "1ygkd3": "**u/DocSmithMD** (Verified Physician) \n\nHey there, I'd advise against combining cold medicine with caffeine to counteract the drowsiness. While it might seem like a convenient solution, it can lead to some unpleasant and potentially serious side effects.\n\nFirstly, many cold medicines contain sedating antihistamines like diphenhydramine, which can interact with caffeine in unpredictable ways. Caffeine is a stimulant, and when combined with these sedatives, it can cause a phenomenon called \"rebound sedation\" - where the stimulant effect wears off, leaving you feeling even more tired and groggy than before.\n\nAdditionally, caffeine can exacerbate the dry mouth, anxiety, and jitteriness that some cold medicines can cause. And, as you've already experienced, it can also lead to lightheadedness and dizziness due to changes in blood pressure and heart rate.\n\nMore seriously, combining these substances can increase your risk of:\n\n* Cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats)\n* Seizures (in rare cases)\n* Dehydration and electrolyte imbalances\n* Worsening of underlying conditions like high blood pressure, anxiety disorders, or sleep apnea\n\nI'd recommend exploring alternative ways to manage your cold symptoms and fatigue, such as:\n\n* Using non-drowsy cold medicines\n* Practicing good sleep hygiene to improve the quality of your rest\n* Engaging in regular physical activity to boost energy levels\n* Staying hydrated and fueling your body with a balanced diet\n\nIf you're experiencing persistent or severe symptoms, I'd encourage you to consult with your primary care physician or a qualified healthcare professional for personalized advice.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when combining medications and substances. Your health and safety are worth it!",
    "1ygqm5": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nHey OP, congratulations on taking the first step by getting a medical checkup and seeking more information about your health. I'd be happy to help clarify things for you.\n\nHaving high cholesterol doesn't automatically mean you have clogged arteries, but it does increase your risk of developing them. Cholesterol is a type of fat found in your blood, and high levels can lead to the buildup of plaque in your arteries, which can cause them to narrow and harden (a process called atherosclerosis). However, the relationship between cholesterol levels and artery health is complex, and many other factors come into play, such as your overall lifestyle, family history, and other health conditions.\n\nTo check for clogged arteries, your doctor may recommend additional tests, such as:\n\n* Lipid profile: This will give a more detailed breakdown of your cholesterol levels, including LDL (bad) cholesterol, HDL (good) cholesterol, and triglycerides.\n* Blood pressure check: High blood pressure can also increase your risk of developing clogged arteries.\n* Imaging tests: Such as a carotid ultrasound or a coronary artery calcium scan, which can help detect plaque buildup in your arteries.\n\nNow, about diet and exercise: a healthy lifestyle can definitely help improve your cholesterol levels and reduce your risk of clogged arteries. A diet low in saturated and trans fats, added sugars, and refined carbohydrates, and high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein sources can help lower your LDL cholesterol and increase your HDL cholesterol.\n\nAs for how long it takes to see results, it varies from person to person, but here are some general guidelines:\n\n* With significant lifestyle changes (diet and exercise), you can start to see improvements in your cholesterol levels within 3-6 months.\n* It may take 6-12 months to see significant reductions in LDL cholesterol and improvements in overall cardiovascular health.\n* However, it's essential to note that reversing existing plaque buildup in your arteries can take longer, often 1-2 years or more, and may require additional medical interventions, such as statin therapy.\n\nRemember, OP, it's great that you're taking proactive steps to manage your health. Be sure to follow up with your doctor and discuss your test results, lifestyle changes, and any concerns you may have. Keep in mind that everyone's journey is different, and it's essential to work with your healthcare team to develop a personalized plan to manage your cholesterol levels and reduce your risk of clogged arteries.\n\n**Edit:** I'll be happy to answer any follow-up questions you may have, OP!",
    "1yhamp": "**u/DocInResidence** (Verified Physician): I'm a neurologist, and I have to say, your symptom list is quite extensive and concerning. While it's possible that stress is contributing to some of these issues, I think it's unlikely to be the sole cause. I'd like to highlight a few symptoms that jump out at me:\n\n* Tinnitus, sensitive hearing, and blurred vision in one eye could be related to a neurological or ENT issue.\n* Headaches, migraines, and neck pain/muscle tension are common, but when combined with other symptoms, they might suggest a underlying condition like a cervical spine issue or even a condition like fibromyalgia.\n* Forgetfulness, twitching, and muscle spasms could be related to a neurological condition, such as a neuromuscular disorder or even a condition like multiple sclerosis (although this is a long shot).\n* The slightly enlarged optic nerve and bouts of vertigo/dizziness are particularly concerning and might suggest a condition affecting the brain or inner ear.\n* Shortness of breath and bronchial cough, despite being diagnosed with stress-related asthma, could indicate an underlying respiratory or cardiac issue.\n\nGiven your age, healthy lifestyle, and lack of abnormal blood tests, I think it's essential to rule out some potential underlying conditions. I would recommend asking your GP to refer you to a neurologist, ENT specialist, or even a cardiologist to further investigate these symptoms.\n\nIn the meantime, I'd like to suggest a few things:\n\n* Keep a symptom journal to track when these issues occur and any potential triggers.\n* Consider getting an MRI or CT scan to rule out any structural issues in your brain or spine.\n* Ask your GP about getting a sleep study to evaluate your insomnia and shortness of breath.\n* Look into stress management techniques, such as meditation, yoga, or cognitive-behavioral therapy, to help cope with any underlying stress or anxiety.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your health. Don't hesitate to push your GP to investigate these symptoms further. You deserve a thorough evaluation to get to the bottom of what's going on.\n\nEdit: I'll add that it's great you're taking care of yourself with regular exercise and a healthy diet. Keep doing what you're doing, and let's work on getting you some answers!",
    "1yhnhz": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nI'd like to start by saying that it's great you're taking an active interest in your health, especially given your family history. Now, regarding your symptoms, I'll do my best to provide some insight.\n\nThe fact that the pain is exacerbated by deep breathing and improves with shallower breaths suggests that it might be related to the lungs or the musculoskeletal system rather than the heart. The pain pattern you're describing, where it worsens with inhalation, is more consistent with a condition like costochondritis (inflammation of the cartilage that connects the ribs to the breastbone) or possibly even a musculoskeletal issue like strained intercostal muscles.\n\nThat being said, it's essential to consider your family history of heart disease, and I would recommend that you schedule an appointment with your primary care physician to discuss these symptoms further. While it's unlikely that you're experiencing angina at your age, it's always better to err on the side of caution.\n\nDuring your appointment, your doctor will likely perform a physical exam, take a detailed medical history, and may order some diagnostic tests (e.g., ECG, chest X-ray) to rule out any underlying conditions. They may also ask you more questions about your symptoms, such as:\n\n* Are the pains sharp, dull, or squeezing?\n* Are they constant or do they come and go?\n* Have you noticed any triggers or factors that make the pain worse or better?\n* Have you experienced any other symptoms like shortness of breath, dizziness, or palpitations?\n\nIn the meantime, I would advise you to keep a symptom journal to track when the pains occur, how long they last, and any potential triggers. This will help your doctor get a better understanding of what you're experiencing.\n\nRemember, it's always better to be safe than sorry, especially when it comes to your health. So, go ahead and schedule that appointment, and let's get to the bottom of this.\n\n**Edit:** I'll add that quitting cigar smoking and reducing alcohol consumption can only benefit your overall health, regardless of the cause of your symptoms.",
    "1yhrsb": "**u/Doc_Gastro** (verified physician) here. I'd be happy to help you out.\n\nFirst, congratulations to your husband on being in remission from Crohn's for 3 years - that's great news!\n\nRegarding his current situation, it's not uncommon for people to experience excessive sleepiness after a viral illness, especially if they were quite sick. This is often due to the body's natural response to infection, which can lead to inflammation and fatigue.\n\nHowever, the fact that he's experiencing instant REM sleep every night at the same time (around 6-7 pm) is a bit unusual. Typically, people take around 90 minutes to enter REM sleep, not 10 minutes.\n\nThere are a few potential explanations for this:\n\n1. **Post-viral fatigue**: As I mentioned earlier, it's possible that his body is still recovering from the viral illness, leading to excessive sleepiness.\n2. **Sleep pressure**: If he's not getting enough sleep or has an irregular sleep schedule, his body might be building up sleep pressure, causing him to fall asleep quickly.\n3. **Underlying sleep disorder**: Although less likely, it's possible that he might have an underlying sleep disorder, such as sleep apnea or narcolepsy, which could be contributing to his excessive sleepiness.\n4. **Hormonal changes**: Some research suggests that viral illnesses can affect hormone levels, including melatonin and cortisol, which regulate sleep-wake cycles.\n\nTo put your mind at ease, I'd recommend that your husband:\n\n1. **Establish a consistent sleep schedule**: Encourage him to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, including weekends.\n2. **Improve sleep hygiene**: Suggest that he avoids screens, heavy meals, and stimulating activities before bedtime.\n3. **Get some morning sunlight**: Exposure to natural light in the morning can help regulate his circadian rhythms.\n4. **Consider a follow-up with his primary care physician**: If his excessive sleepiness persists or worsens, it's always a good idea to rule out any underlying conditions that might need medical attention.\n\nKeep in mind that I'm just a Reddit doc, and it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional in person for a thorough evaluation.\n\nHope this helps, and please let me know if you have any further questions!",

As a physician, I have to say that your story raises several red flags, and I'm concerned about your overall health.\n\nFirstly, the episode of debilitating lower stomach pain 7 years ago, followed by significant weight loss, is a classic presentation of a potential underlying condition that needs to be investigated. The fact that you haven't seen a doctor since then is alarming, and I strongly advise you to seek medical attention ASAP.\n\nThe red painful bumps on your neck, which have been persistent for 5 years, could be indicative of an underlying inflammatory or infectious process. The pilonidal cyst, although common, can be a sign of an underlying issue with your immune system or digestive health.\n\nNow, regarding your fear of needles, I completely understand. However, it's essential to address your underlying health issues, and sometimes, that requires medical procedures that involve needles or IVs. I want to assure you that there are ways to manage your anxiety and fear, such as using topical anesthetics, sedation, or even counseling.\n\nThe most concerning aspect of your post is the episodes of chest pain and loss of consciousness, which suggest a potential cardiac issue. The fact that your heart stopped during one of these episodes is a significant red flag, and I strongly advise you to seek immediate medical attention.\n\nIn Toronto, there are several hospitals and clinics that offer anxiety-friendly and pain-management services. I recommend reaching out to a hospital or clinic that has a multidisciplinary team, including pain management specialists, cardiologists, and gastroenterologists.\n\nTo get you started, I suggest contacting the University Health Network (UHN) or the Sinai Health System, both of which have excellent teams and resources to address your complex medical issues. You can also reach out to the Ontario Telemedicine Network (OTN) for virtual consultations and guidance.\n\nRemember, your health is paramount, and it's essential to address these issues to prevent further complications.

    "1yhta6": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nI'd love to help you and your girlfriend out. Based on your description, it's possible that the \"long bloody looking thing\" she pulled out is indeed a blood clot or a piece of nasal mucosa that had formed as a result of the bleeding. The fact that the bleeding stopped immediately after she pulled it out suggests that it may have been the source of the bleeding.\n\nHowever, I do have to advise that it's generally not recommended to pull or manipulate any foreign objects or tissues from the nose, as this can lead to further injury or infection.\n\nIf your girlfriend is still concerned, I would recommend that she schedule an appointment with an ENT (ear, nose, and throat) specialist or a primary care physician to get checked out. They can take a look at her nose and make sure there's no underlying issue that needs to be addressed.\n\nAs for the picture, I appreciate your offer, but I don't think it's necessary to post it here. If your girlfriend does end up seeing a doctor, they can take a look at the picture and her nose in person to make a more informed assessment.\n\nPlease do keep an eye on her and make sure she's not experiencing any further bleeding, pain, or discomfort.

    "1yink3": "**u/DocSmithMD** (Verified Physician) \n\nWow, that's a fascinating anecdote! As a physician, I'd like to offer some insights. While it's great that you're experiencing these positive changes, it's essential to consider the potential underlying factors.\n\nFirstly, it's possible that the caffeine withdrawal is contributing to your reduced hunger and fatigue. Caffeine is a stimulant that can increase appetite and energy, but it can also lead to rebound fatigue when its effects wear off. By switching to water, you're essentially detoxing from caffeine, which might be helping your body regulate its natural hunger and energy rhythms.\n\nAdditionally, soda is high in sugar, calories, and artificial ingredients that can disrupt your metabolism and energy levels. By cutting out soda, you're likely reducing your overall calorie intake and minimizing the negative effects of these substances on your body.\n\nThat being said, water itself does have numerous benefits, including improving digestion, boosting metabolism, and enhancing satiety (feeling full). It's possible that drinking water is helping your body function more efficiently, leading to the positive changes you're experiencing.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider the placebo effect and the power of expectation. As you've made a conscious decision to change your behavior, you might be more mindful of your hunger and energy levels, which could be influencing your perception of these changes.\n\nTo determine whether these effects are sustainable and truly related to drinking water, I'd recommend continuing to monitor your progress and making other healthy lifestyle changes, such as a balanced diet and regular exercise. It's also essential to consult with a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to your weight or energy levels.\n\nKeep in mind that everyone's body is different, and it's crucial to approach these changes with a critical and nuanced perspective. Nevertheless, it's great that you're taking steps towards a healthier lifestyle, and I'm excited to see how your journey progresses!",
    "1yiwhh": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nI'd like to offer some insights on your symptoms. First, I must commend you on being diligent about seeking medical attention and undergoing various tests to rule out common causes of urinary frequency and urgency.\n\nGiven your negative urine test, normal blood work, and lack of pain, it's indeed puzzling. I agree with you that Interstitial Cystitis (IC) is a possibility, although it's less common in young males. However, IC can present with varying degrees of pain, and some patients may not experience pain at all, especially in the early stages.\n\nI'd like to propose a few other potential explanations:\n\n1. **Overactive Bladder (OAB)**: This condition is characterized by urinary urgency and frequency, often without pain or other symptoms. It's more common in women, but men can be affected too.\n2. **Anxiety or stress-related urinary frequency**: Sometimes, stress or anxiety can contribute to urinary frequency and urgency. Have you experienced any significant stressors or changes in your life recently?\n3. **Hormonal influences**: Although less likely, hormonal fluctuations can affect bladder function. Have you noticed any other symptoms like changes in libido, mood, or energy levels?\n4. **Previous antibiotic use**: You mentioned that your symptoms started after stopping doxycycline. Although unlikely, it's possible that the antibiotic may have altered your gut microbiome, leading to changes in bladder function.\n\nRegarding your kidney check, it's a good idea to rule out any underlying kidney issues, even if pain is not a prominent symptom.\n\nTo further investigate, I would recommend:\n\n1. **Bladder diary**: Keep a detailed record of your fluid intake, urine output, and any symptoms you experience. This can help identify patterns and potential triggers.\n2. **Urodynamic testing**: This series of tests can assess your bladder function, including its ability to store and empty urine.\n3. **Consider a trial of OAB medications**: If your urologist suspects OAB, they may prescribe medications like antimuscarinics or beta-3 adrenergic agonists to help manage symptoms.\n\nRemember, it's essential to work closely with your urologist to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. Don't hesitate to ask questions or seek a second opinion if you're not satisfied with your current diagnosis or treatment plan.\n\nKeep us updated on your progress, and I'll be happy to provide further guidance or insights!",
    "1ykp41": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nI'd advise against stopping the antibiotics abruptly, despite the negative strep test. Here's why:\n\nEven though the strep test came back negative, it's possible that you have another bacterial infection that's responding to the antibiotics. Stopping the course prematurely could lead to the infection not being fully cleared, which might result in a relapse or even complications.\n\nIt's also important to note that antibiotics can sometimes provide symptom relief due to their anti-inflammatory properties, which might explain why you felt better soon after starting them. However, this doesn't necessarily mean the underlying infection has been fully treated.\n\nYour cousin's advice to continue for a few more days is reasonable, but I'd recommend finishing the full 10-day course as prescribed by your doctor. This will ensure that any potential bacterial infection is fully treated and reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance.\n\nAs for drinking this weekend, I'd caution against it, especially if you're still taking antibiotics. Alcohol can interact with certain antibiotics and decrease their effectiveness. Additionally, it's generally not a good idea to drink while taking antibiotics, as it can exacerbate side effects like stomach upset and dizziness.\n\nSo, to summarize: finish the full course of antibiotics as prescribed, and consider postponing your drinking plans until you've completed the treatment and are feeling fully recovered.\n\n**Edit:** I'll add that if you're concerned about the diagnosis or treatment, it's always best to follow up with your doctor or a qualified healthcare professional for personalized advice.",

The symptoms you're describing are concerning and warrant further evaluation.\n\nThe fact that someone else can feel the \"ball-like thing\" above your belly button and to the left, especially when you cough, suggests that it may be a palpable mass. Given your pregnancy, it's possible that this could be related to a hernia, a cyst, or even a bowel obstruction (although less likely).\n\nWhile the pain has decreased, it's still important to get this checked out ASAP. As a pregnant woman, you're at a higher risk for certain complications, and it's always better to err on the side of caution.\n\nI would strongly recommend finding a doctor in your current location and getting an evaluation as soon as possible.

I'm glad you're seeing a doctor later today, as they'll be able to provide a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\nIn the meantime, I can offer some suggestions to help alleviate your symptoms. For the pain, you can try gargling with warm salt water (1/4 teaspoon of salt in 8 ounces of water) several times a day. This can help reduce swelling and ease the discomfort. You can also try sucking on ice chips or popsicles to help numb the area.\n\nAs for your concern about taking large pills, don't worry, most antibiotics for strep throat come in a variety of forms, including liquids and smaller pills. If you do end up needing antibiotics, your doctor will likely prescribe a medication like amoxicillin or azithromycin, which are commonly used to treat strep throat. These medications are usually available in liquid or capsule form, and the capsules are often relatively small.\n\nIf you do receive a liquid medication, the taste can vary depending on the specific medication and brand. However, many liquid antibiotics are flavored to make them more palatable. If you're really struggling with the taste, you can try mixing it with a small amount of water or a flavored drink, like apple juice, to make it more tolerable.\n\nRemember to stay hydrated by drinking small amounts of water or other fluids, even if it's just a sip at a time. You can also try eating soft, bland foods like yogurt, scrambled eggs, or mashed potatoes to help ease your throat discomfort.\n\nHang in there, OP, and try to get some rest until you see your doctor later today. They'll be able to provide a proper diagnosis and get you started on the right treatment plan.\n\n**Edit:** Just a reminder to follow your doctor's advice and take any prescribed medication as directed.

    "1yx53v": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nInteresting case! I'd be happy to help you out while you wait to see your doc. \n\nFirst, let's break down the information you've provided. Your Erythropoietin (EPO) level is 10.5 mIU/mL, which is within the normal range (4.2-27.8). This is a good point to consider when evaluating the potential causes of your polycythemia.\n\nNow, regarding your newly diagnosed severe sleep apnea, it's true that chronic hypoxia can stimulate EPO production, leading to secondary polycythemia. However, in your case, the EPO level is not elevated, which makes it less likely that sleep apnea is the primary cause of your polycythemia.\n\nThat being said, it's essential to note that sleep apnea can still contribute to polycythemia, even with normal EPO levels. The intermittent hypoxia associated with sleep apnea can lead to other mechanisms that promote erythrocytosis (increased red blood cell production), such as increased sympathetic tone, inflammation, and oxidative stress.\n\nGiven your negative JAK2-V617F test and the fact that your doc is still investigating, it's possible that your polycythemia is indeed primary (e.g., polycythemia vera). However, it's also important to consider that sleep apnea could be a contributing factor, even if it's not the sole cause.\n\nI would recommend discussing your sleep apnea diagnosis with your doc when you see them in 10 days. They may want to consider treating your sleep apnea and reassessing your polycythemia after treatment to see if there's any improvement. Additionally, the bone marrow biopsy results will be crucial in helping to differentiate between primary and secondary polycythemia.\n\nHang in there, and I hope you get some answers soon!",

That's definitely something to celebrate. Now, regarding your question: it's possible that the stomach flu could have affected your test results, but it's not a straightforward answer.\n\nWhen you're ill, especially with a gastrointestinal infection like the stomach flu, your body's metabolism and liver function can be altered. This can lead to changes in your lipid profiles, including a temporary decrease in cholesterol levels. This is because your liver is busy dealing with the infection and may not be producing as much cholesterol as it normally would.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that the stomach flu didn't have a significant impact on your test results, especially if you'd already started making lifestyle changes or adjustments to your medication regimen that are helping to lower your cholesterol.\n\nTo get a better sense of what's going on, I'd recommend talking to your doctor about getting a follow-up test in a few weeks to see if your cholesterol levels are still low. This will help determine if the stomach flu was just a temporary factor or if you're truly making progress in managing your cholesterol.\n\nIn the meantime, keep doing what you're doing, and don't be afraid to ask your doctor questions about your test results and what they might mean for your health. \n\n**Edit:** I should note that dehydration from the stomach flu can also affect test results, so make sure you're well-hydrated before getting any follow-up tests.",
    "1yylo9": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nI'm glad you're considering seeking medical attention, and I would strongly advise against waiting until the weekend to see a doctor. While it's reassuring that you're not experiencing any pain or discomfort, the fact that you're regurgitating what appears to be a lining (possibly gastric mucosa) is a concerning symptom that warrants prompt evaluation.\n\nGiven your recent history of food poisoning, acid reflux diagnosis, and minor esophageal damage, it's possible that you may be experiencing a complication such as an esophageal ulcer or a gastric mucosal tear. The fact that you're not feeling any pain doesn't necessarily mean that everything is okay, as some serious conditions can be asymptomatic or have atypical presentations.\n\nI would recommend that you contact your primary care physician or a gastroenterologist ASAP to schedule an urgent appointment. They will likely want to perform an upper endoscopy to visualize your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to determine the cause of the regurgitated lining.\n\nIn the meantime, it's a good idea to avoid solid foods and stick to a liquid diet to reduce the risk of further irritation or injury. You can also try to manage your acid reflux symptoms by avoiding trigger foods, elevating the head of your bed, and taking your prescribed antacids or acid reducers as directed.\n\nPlease don't delay seeking medical attention, as early evaluation and treatment can help prevent potential complications and promote a speedy recovery.\n\n**Edit:** I'll add that if you experience any of the following symptoms, you should seek immediate attention at an ER: severe chest pain, difficulty swallowing, vomiting blood, or severe abdominal pain.",

I'd like to offer some insights, but please keep in mind that this is not a substitute for an in-person evaluation.\n\nIt's great to hear that the painful urination has largely resolved with antibiotics, suggesting that the UTI was indeed the culprit. However, the persistent mild pains in your lower right abdomen and left lower back are concerning and warrant further investigation.\n\nGiven your symptoms, here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. **Residual infection**: Although the antibiotics may have cleared up the UTI, it's possible that some bacterial remnants or inflammation are still present, causing the abdominal and back pains.\n2. **Kidney stone**: The sharp, stinging pain you experienced on Thursday night could be indicative of a kidney stone, especially if it was severe and fleeting. The constant mild pains in your lower back and abdomen might be related to a stone that's not yet passed.\n3. **Musculoskeletal issue**: It's possible that the pains are unrelated to the UTI and are instead caused by a musculoskeletal issue, such as a strained muscle or poor posture.\n4. **Other conditions**: Less likely, but still possible, are conditions like appendicitis (although you'd likely have more severe symptoms), a hernia, or even a spinal issue.\n\nI would recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment with your primary care physician or a urologist to discuss your ongoing symptoms. They may want to:\n\n* Perform a physical exam to assess for any tenderness or abnormalities\n* Order imaging studies (e.g., ultrasound, CT scan) to rule out kidney stones or other issues\n* Run some blood work to check for signs of infection or inflammation\n* Consider a urine culture to ensure the UTI is fully cleared\n\nIn the meantime, you can try to manage your symptoms with over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. However, if you experience any severe pain, vomiting, or difficulty urinating, seek medical attention promptly.\n\nRemember, this is just a hypothetical discussion, and a proper evaluation by a healthcare professional is essential to determine the cause of your symptoms.\n\nEdit: I'll be happy to answer any follow-up questions you may have!",
    "1zbk0t": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nHey there, sorry to hear you're experiencing recurring stomach pains and changes in your bowel movements. I'll try to offer some insights, but please keep in mind that this is not a substitute for a proper medical consultation.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you're considering your family history of coeliac disease, and trying a gluten-free diet may be a good idea. However, as you've noted, your symptoms don't entirely align with classic coeliac disease presentation.\n\nThe symptoms you've described, such as stomach pains after eating and changes in stool consistency, could be related to several possible conditions. Here are a few potential causes:\n\n1. **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)**: This is a common condition characterized by abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, and stool consistency. It's often triggered by food, stress, or other factors.\n2. **Lactose intolerance or other food intolerances**: You may be experiencing an adverse reaction to certain foods, such as dairy, gluten, or high-FODMAP foods.\n3. **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**: This condition can cause stomach pain, bloating, and changes in bowel movements, especially after eating.\n4. **Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)**: Although less likely, conditions like Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis can cause similar symptoms.\n\nIt's essential to consult a doctor to rule out any underlying conditions that may require medical attention. They will likely perform a physical examination, take a detailed medical history, and may order some tests (e.g., blood work, stool tests, or imaging studies) to help determine the cause of your symptoms.\n\nIn the meantime, keeping a food diary to track your symptoms and any potential triggers may be helpful. Also, make sure to stay hydrated and consider speaking with a registered dietitian or a healthcare professional for personalized guidance on managing your symptoms.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution and consult a doctor if you're experiencing persistent or severe symptoms. They can help you develop a plan to address your concerns and improve your overall health.\n\n**Edit:** I'll add that it's great you're taking proactive steps to manage your health, and I encourage you to follow up with a doctor soon to discuss your symptoms in more detail.",
    "1zuimm": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nI'd like to offer some insight, but please keep in mind that this is not a substitute for a proper medical evaluation. It's great that you're reaching out for advice, but I do want to encourage you to consider consulting a doctor if your symptoms persist or worsen.\n\nBased on your description, there are a few possible explanations for your symptoms. The redness, heat, and burning sensation in your knees, particularly after standing for a period, could be related to:\n\n1. **Poor circulation**: As a slender individual, you might be more prone to poor circulation, which can cause your knees to feel hot and red after standing.\n2. **Patellofemoral pain syndrome**: This is a common condition that affects the knee joint, causing pain, heat, and redness, especially after activities that put stress on the knee, like standing or walking.\n3. **Growing pains**: Although you're 17, some people can still experience growing pains, which can cause knee pain, redness, and heat.\n4. **Overuse or repetitive strain**: If you've recently increased your physical activity or changed your daily routine, you might be putting extra stress on your knees, leading to these symptoms.\n\nThe fact that your knees used to \"pop out\" when you knelt and twisted is interesting. This could be related to a **subluxation** (partial dislocation) of the patella (kneecap) or a **ligamentous laxity** (looseness of the ligaments). However, without further evaluation, it's difficult to say for certain.\n\nI would recommend that you consider consulting a primary care physician or an orthopedic specialist to discuss your symptoms in more detail. They can perform a physical examination, take a more detailed history, and potentially order imaging studies (e.g., X-rays) to rule out any underlying conditions that may need attention.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try some simple measures to alleviate your symptoms, such as:\n\n* Taking regular breaks to rest and stretch your legs\n* Applying ice or cold compresses to your knees to reduce heat and inflammation\n* Wearing comfortable, supportive shoes\n* Avoiding activities that exacerbate your symptoms\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your health. If you're concerned about your symptoms, don't hesitate to seek medical attention.\n\n**Edit:** I'll be happy to answer any follow-up questions you may have, but please keep in mind that I'm not a substitute for a face-to-face medical evaluation.",
    "1zvo5f": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nOP, thanks for sharing your concerns. I'll try to help you out. The symptoms you're describing - redness, itching, and irritation on the top part of the foreskin and the underside (which is called the inner prepuce or mucosal surface), along with a yellowish discharge - could be indicative of a few different conditions.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you've never had sex, which reduces the likelihood of an STI (sexually transmitted infection). However, it's still possible to develop other types of infections or conditions.\n\nOne possibility is balanitis, which is an inflammation of the glans penis (the head of the penis) and the foreskin. This can be caused by poor hygiene, irritation, or an infection (bacterial, fungal, or viral). The yellowish discharge you're seeing could be a sign of an infection.\n\nAnother possibility is smegma buildup. Smegma is a natural, cheesy-like substance that can accumulate under the foreskin, especially if you don't practice good hygiene. This can cause irritation, redness, and itching.\n\nMasturbation itself is unlikely to cause these symptoms, but if you're not cleaning yourself properly after masturbating, you might be introducing bacteria or other irritants into the area.\n\nI would recommend seeing a doctor (preferably a urologist or a primary care physician) to get a proper diagnosis and treatment. In the meantime, make sure to practice good hygiene:\n\n* Gently clean the area with mild soap and water\n* Dry the area thoroughly, especially after showering or bathing\n* Avoid using harsh soaps or scrubbing the area\n* Consider using a gentle, fragrance-free cleanser\n\nDon't hesitate to reach out to a doctor if your symptoms worsen or persist. We can help you figure out what's going on and get you the right treatment.\n\n**Edit:** I'll add that if you experience any increase in symptoms, difficulty urinating, or fever, you should seek medical attention promptly.",
    "1zw3cc": "\"Verified MD here. Unfortunately, it seems like the OP's question got cut off, and 'nan' isn't giving us much to go on. Could you please rephrase or provide more context about what you're trying to ask? I'd be happy to help with any medical questions you have to the best of my ability\"",
    "1zwot6": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nHey OP, sorry to hear about your high cholesterol and iron deficiency diagnosis. I'll try to provide some specific and actionable advice.\n\nFirstly, let's break down your cholesterol numbers. An LDL of 235 is indeed high, and your HDL of 38 is lower than ideal. As a college student, I understand that your schedule can be unpredictable, but making some targeted changes can help.\n\nFor diet, I recommend focusing on the following:\n\n1. **Soluble fiber**: Increase your intake of soluble fiber-rich foods like oats, barley, fruits (especially apples, berries, and pears), and vegetables (like broccoli, carrots, and brussels sprouts). Aim for 25-30 grams of soluble fiber per day. This can help lower your LDL by 5-10%.\n2. **Plant-based protein**: Incorporate more plant-based protein sources like beans, lentils, and tofu into your meals. These can help reduce your LDL and increase your HDL.\n3. **Healthy fats**: Nuts, seeds, avocados, and olive oil are all great sources of healthy fats that can help improve your HDL and lower your LDL.\n4. **Limit saturated and trans fats**: Try to avoid or limit foods high in saturated and trans fats like red meat, full-fat dairy products, and processed snacks.\n\nGiven your erratic schedule, consider meal prepping or cooking in bulk on the weekends. You can also keep healthy snacks like nuts, fruits, and carrot sticks with hummus handy.\n\nFor exercise, I recommend a combination of aerobic exercise and strength training. Here's a simple routine to get you started:\n\n1. **Brisk walking**: Aim for at least 30 minutes of brisk walking per day. You can break this up into shorter sessions if needed.\n2. **Bodyweight exercises**: Incorporate strength training exercises like push-ups, squats, lunges, and planks into your routine. Aim for 2-3 sessions per week.\n3. **High-intensity interval training (HIIT)**: Try incorporating HIIT workouts 2-3 times a week. These can be as short as 15-20 minutes and can be done with bodyweight exercises or using equipment like a stationary bike or rowing machine.\n\nHere's a sample workout routine you can follow:\n\n* Monday (30 minutes): Brisk walking + bodyweight exercises (push-ups, squats, lunges)\n* Wednesday (20 minutes): HIIT workout (sprints, burpees, jump squats)\n* Friday (30 minutes): Brisk walking + bodyweight exercises (planks, lunges, push-ups)\n\nRemember to consult with your doctor before starting any new exercise routine.\n\nRegarding your iron deficiency, it's great that you've started taking iron tablets. In addition to your medication, make sure to include iron-rich foods in your diet like:\n\n1. **Red meat**: Lean cuts of red meat like beef, pork, and lamb are rich in iron.\n2. **Poultry**: Chicken and turkey are good sources of iron.\n3. **Fish**: Fatty fish like salmon and tuna are rich in iron.\n4. **Legumes**: Beans, lentils, and peas are all high in iron.\n5. **Fortified cereals**: Many breakfast cereals are fortified with iron, making them a convenient option.\n\nVitamin C can help increase iron absorption, so try to consume foods high in vitamin C (like citrus fruits, bell peppers, and tomatoes) along with your iron-rich foods.\n\nLastly, I recommend consulting with a registered dietitian or a healthcare professional to create a personalized plan tailored to your needs and lifestyle.\n\nKeep in mind that it may take some time to see improvements in your cholesterol and iron levels. Be patient, stay consistent, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns.\n\n**Edit:** I've linked a few resources below that may help you get started:\n\n* American Heart Association's (AHA) cholesterol management guide: [link](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/nutrition-basics/aha-diet-and-lifestyle-recommendations)\n* Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics' (AND) iron deficiency guide: [link](https://www.andjrnl.org/article/S2212-2672(20)30043-4/)\n* NIH's exercise and physical activity guide: [link](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/eat/calories.htm)\n\nFeel free to ask me any follow-up questions!",
    "1zwrt7": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nSorry to hear you're struggling with sleep while on Oxycontin for your L1-T12 injury. I'll try to offer some insights, but please keep in mind that I'm not your treating physician, and any changes to your medication regimen should be discussed with your doctor.\n\nFirstly, it's not uncommon for opioids like Oxycontin to interfere with sleep. As you've found, morphine-based products can be effective, but we need to explore other options that might help with both pain and sleep.\n\nHave you considered talking to your doctor about switching to a different opioid, such as hydromorphone (Dilaudid) or fentanyl, which might have a more favorable side effect profile for sleep? Additionally, you may want to discuss the possibility of adding a medication specifically for sleep, such as a non-benzodiazepine like zolpidem (Ambien) or eszopiclone (Lunesta).\n\nRegarding your mention of Valium, it's worth noting that benzodiazepines can be habit-forming and are generally not recommended for long-term use. However, there are some alternative medications that might provide similar anxiolytic effects without the same risks. For example, your doctor might consider prescribing a medication like pregabalin (Lyrica), which can help with anxiety and sleep, in addition to its pain-relieving properties.\n\nIt's also important to address the underlying sleep disturbance. Have you tried any non-pharmacological interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), relaxation techniques, or sleep hygiene practices? These can be effective in improving sleep quality and might be worth exploring in conjunction with any medication changes.\n\nRemember, it's essential to work closely with your healthcare provider to find the best solution for your specific situation. I hope this information is helpful, and I wish you the best in finding a more effective treatment plan. **Edit:** As always, please consult your treating physician before making any changes to your medication regimen.",
    "1zx1g6": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nThank you for sharing your story and the images. I'll do my best to provide some insights. Please keep in mind that I'm not replacing your chiropractor or primary care physician, but rather offering a neutral, third-party perspective.\n\nFrom the X-rays, it appears you have a significant thoracolumbar scoliosis with a Cobb angle of approximately 40-50 degrees. This is a relatively moderate to severe curvature. The neck X-ray shows some loss of lordosis, which is consistent with your forward head posture.\n\nGiven your long-standing symptoms and the chiropractor's prognosis, it's essential to consider a multidisciplinary approach to manage your condition. While chiropractic care can be beneficial for some, it may not be enough to address the underlying structural issues.\n\nI would recommend consulting with an orthopedic surgeon or a physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R) physician to discuss potential options for managing your scoliosis and related symptoms. They can help you explore other treatments, such as:\n\n1. Physical therapy: A customized exercise program to improve your posture, strengthen your core, and enhance flexibility.\n2. Bracing: Depending on the severity of your scoliosis, a brace may be recommended to help stabilize your spine and prevent further curvature.\n3. Pain management: Your headaches and general discomfort may be related to your scoliosis. A pain management specialist can help you develop a plan to address these symptoms.\n\nThe foot pressure analysis is interesting, but without more context, it's challenging to interpret. However, it's possible that your foot mechanics may be contributing to your back and neck pain. A podiatrist or a physical therapist with expertise in foot biomechanics may be able to help you address any underlying issues.\n\nLastly, I would encourage you to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, a balanced diet, and stress management techniques. These can help alleviate your symptoms and improve your overall well-being.\n\nRemember, every individual is unique, and it's crucial to work with a team of healthcare professionals to develop a personalized plan tailored to your needs.\n\n**Edit:** I'll be happy to answer any follow-up questions you may have.

    "1zx2l9": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nI totally understand your confusion, and I'm happy to help clarify things for you. Dexamethasone acetate pomade is a topical corticosteroid, and it's indeed indicated for various skin conditions, including itching and inflammation. However, as you've read, one of the potential side effects of dexamethasone (and many other corticosteroids) is, ironically, hives or urticaria.\n\nNow, here's the important part: while dexamethasone can cause hives as a side effect, it's still possible that it could help alleviate your hives symptoms in the short term. The key is to use it judiciously and under the right circumstances.\n\nIf you're experiencing severe itching, redness, and discomfort from your hives, you could try applying a small amount of dexamethasone acetate pomade to a discrete area to see if it helps. **However, please exercise caution**: if you notice any worsening of symptoms, increased redness, or difficulty breathing, stop using it immediately and seek medical attention.\n\nIt's great that you have a dermatologist appointment scheduled for next week. In the meantime, you may also consider taking an oral antihistamine like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or loratadine (Claritin) to help alleviate your itching and hives symptoms. Just be sure to follow the recommended dosage and talk to your doctor about any potential interactions with other medications you're taking.\n\nRemember, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new medication, especially if you're unsure about potential side effects or interactions. Your dermatologist will be able to assess your condition and provide personalized guidance on the best course of treatment.\n\nHang in there, and I hope you get some relief from your symptoms soon!",
    "1zxlol": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nI'd like to start by saying that it's great you're taking an active role in your health and seeking answers. However, I must emphasize that self-diagnosis via Google can be misleading and anxiety-provoking.\n\nRegarding your back pain, it's unlikely to be related to pancreatic or lung cancer, especially given the fact that you've been able to significantly reduce the pain using self-massage techniques and that the pain has been relatively stable over the past 6 months. The location of the pain, near the left shoulder blade, is more consistent with musculoskeletal issues, such as a strained muscle or a trigger point.\n\nThe fact that you can feel a band of muscle in that area and that pressing your back against a wall and using a tennis ball helped alleviate the pain suggests that the issue is likely related to muscle tension or scar tissue.\n\nAs for your nail clubbing, I've taken a look at the pictures you provided, and while it's difficult to make a definitive diagnosis without a physical examination, your nails do appear to have some features consistent with clubbing, such as an increased curvature of the nail plate and a possible increase in the angle between the nail plate and the proximal nail fold. However, clubbing can be a benign finding, especially if it's been present since childhood, as you mentioned.\n\nIt's also worth noting that your history of allergies, chronic hives, and possible polycythemia (increased red blood cell count) could be related to an underlying condition, such as a myeloproliferative disorder. However, this would require further evaluation and testing to determine.\n\nI would recommend scheduling an appointment with your primary care physician to discuss your symptoms and medical history in more detail. They can perform a physical examination, review your medical history, and order any necessary tests to help determine the cause of your back pain and nail clubbing.\n\nIn the meantime, try not to worry too much about the possibility of pancreatic or lung cancer. While it's always better to err on the side of caution, the likelihood of these conditions in a 22-year-old male with a stable and relatively mild symptom profile is low.\n\n**Edit:** I'll add that it's great you're taking the initiative to seek answers and being proactive about your health. Keep doing that, and don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider with any concerns or questions you may have!",
    "201zmh": "**Verified Physician here**\n\nOP, I'm glad you're reaching out for reassurance. As a doc, I always err on the side of caution when it comes to chest pain. While your symptoms and medical history suggest that a heart attack is unlikely, I still want to emphasize that chest pain should never be taken lightly.\n\nThat being said, the fact that you're experiencing sharp, wave-like chest pain that comes and goes, and has occurred on both sides of your chest, does make me think of other possible causes. Muscle strain from your upper body workout is definitely a possibility, especially given the timing. Costochondritis (inflammation of the cartilage that connects your ribs to your breastbone) is another potential cause, as is anxiety or stress-related chest tightness (which could be exacerbated by your Zoloft).\n\nHowever, I still want to stress that it's always better to be safe than sorry. If you're experiencing any of the following, please seek medical attention immediately:\n\n* Severe or persistent chest pain\n* Shortness of breath\n* Dizziness or lightheadedness\n* Pain or discomfort in your arms, back, neck, jaw, or stomach\n* Nausea or vomiting\n\nIf you're not experiencing any of these symptoms, I would still recommend scheduling an appointment with your primary care physician to discuss your symptoms and get a thorough evaluation. They can perform a physical exam, take a detailed medical history, and potentially order some tests (e.g., ECG, chest X-ray) to rule out any underlying conditions.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to chest pain. Don't hesitate to seek medical attention if you're unsure or if your symptoms worsen.\n\n**Edit:** I should note that while Zoloft is not typically associated with chest pain, it's possible that you may be experiencing some sort of medication-related side effect. Discussing your symptoms with your prescribing physician or a cardiologist may be helpful in determining the cause of your chest pain.",
    "2027q3": "**u/DocOrtho**: Hey fellow Redditors, verified orthopedic surgeon here. I'll try to provide some insight into this situation.\n\nFirstly, it's great that you're concerned about your coworker's health, and it's even more impressive that you're thinking about potential underlying conditions. However, I have to say that Post-Polio Syndrome (PPS) is a bit of a stretch without more information.\n\nPPS typically occurs in individuals who have had a confirmed diagnosis of poliomyelitis (polio) in the past, usually during childhood. The symptoms you've described, such as weakness, tremors, and lack of muscle development, could be related to various conditions, not just PPS.\n\nThat being said, it's possible that your coworker may have had a condition that affected her muscle development or led to ongoing weakness, which could be related to her past hospitalization for a broken leg. Perhaps she had a complication, such as a nerve injury or a condition like osteogenesis imperfecta, that has contributed to her current symptoms.\n\nAs for approaching your coworker, I would suggest being empathetic and non-judgmental. You could express your concern for her health and well-being, and encourage her to speak with her primary care physician about her symptoms. It's essential to avoid making assumptions or diagnoses, as that can be alienating and unhelpful.\n\nHere's an example of how you could approach the conversation:\n\n\"Hey [coworker's name], I've noticed that you seem to be struggling with weakness and fatigue sometimes. I'm concerned about your health, and I want to make sure you're doing okay. Have you talked to your doctor about how you're feeling? Maybe they can help you figure out what's going on and find ways to support you.\"\n\nRemember to prioritize your coworker's feelings and boundaries, and avoid pushing her to discuss something she's not comfortable with. By being a supportive and caring colleague, you can help her feel more at ease and encourage her to seek medical attention if needed."
